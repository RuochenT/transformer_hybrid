Until recently, I've had no preference to any brand, as I felt they were all pretty similar.  After seeing some of the awards that Pattern Body Wash has received in various men's magazines I decided to try it for myself.

On opening the bottle, the fragrance was not overpowering or chemical-smelling, at all;  in fact, it was quite the opposite,  It has a great aroma with, not really a subtle scent, rather more subdued, and certainly not overwhelming.  In addition to nutmeg, I have also tried citrus, eucalyptus, cucumber, sage and black pepper, and all of them have been outstanding fragrances.  I was also impressed by the small amount of gel needed to clean the entire body.  Many of the other brands that I have tried seem to over-foam and usually leave a little residue that needs a secondary rinse to remove.  This is not the case with any of the Pattern products I have tried.  The body wash is silky, with just the right amount of lather, and it cleans exceptionally well.

One of the other areas, in which I compare body washes, is the dryness that ensues after toweling off after a shower.  Pattern is exceptional in this realm and leaves the skin smooth and soft, even in a very dry climate with little humidity.

The price point is certainly several dollars more than I would normally spend on a standard body wash, but in all truth, one bottle lasts longer than all of the other companies I have tried over the past 20 years.

Great job Pattern on a fantastic product, you have made a routine shower a much better experience.",1379548800,0,0,0,0,1

All the same features are here, from what I can tell, and the changes are only cosmetic. The revision is so minor that it doesn't even have its own model number. Only the number after the slash has changed (from 02 to 07).

Aside from the silly camelCased marketing terms (KidTimer, KidPacer), it's the same product as the older revision. Two power modes let your child ease into the brushing experience. For new Sonicare users, they may feel some tingling in their gums. This goes away after a few days as the gums adjust to the new sensation. The KidPacer (QuadTimer for the adult line) stops and beeps to tell your child to move on to another section of his or her mouth.

I love the Sonicare line and own 3 other toothbrushes (I keep one at the office, home, parent's home when I visit). My dentist recommnends Sonicare as well. Their kids line offers the same quality construction and ease of use as the adult lines. The charger base is interchangeable and usable with other Sonicare products.",1389657600,0,0,0,0,1

While they usually do not bother me, they do make me self conscious during a swimming season.  The texture of my skin over the stretch mark area is not smooth anymore, so I do not believe a cream would make them completely disappear but I hope that it might make them fade and become less noticeable.  I just got another cream from Royal Sea recently and was so impressed with it, so I ordered this cream as well.

I received Royal Sea promptly and it was packaged in a heavy dark glass jar with a heavy plastic lid tightly wrapped in a bubble wrap.  Unfortunately, despite the protection, the lid was cracked when I received it.  The jar was sealed.  The cream itself is white and has a medium consistency.  I love the scent very much!  It smells like a blend of essential oils with ylang ylang being the most prominent.  The cream was easy to apply and was absorbed quickly and completely without leaving a greasy residue.  There was no stinging or any irritation upon the application.  I have been using this stretch cream for a few days now but I believe it is unreasonable to expect any noticeable changes in such a short period, especially for the old stretch marks.  I think it will take at least weeks and probably a few jars of cream to see any difference.  I am going to continue using it and will update my review if I see any changes in my stretch marks.

1716,5,"12 11, 2007",A28N2AWOVO2PB,B000PKKAGO,"I used to wonder what caused redness and skin irritation every time I shaved. When it started for me I tried switching to environmentally friendly shaving cream, then I changed my shaving blades, then I tried changing my aftershave, but nothing helped. Regardless of what I did the irritation always came back.

I think I finally found the answer after I started using the new Philips Norelco drive-shave system. First, let me sing a praise for its smooth design and ingenious way of reminding me when I need to clean the blades (a cool blue image of a water faucet appears on the handle immediately after each shave) and how many minutes of battery life remain (cool blue large numbers appear after every shave as a reminder). As far as I am concerned these are the two main things I need to know so that I can get the job done.  Next, let share with you how wonderful I feel after each shave. The benefits of dry shaving prevented my skin from being exposed to the sharp blades and water, which in my opinion are solely responsible for the irritation of my skin.

If I could recommend one minor improvement, it would be to make the system's blades sensitive enough to be able to remove even the smallest or toughest hairs on my neck. I find myself having to reapply some circulating effort around the same areas every time until I get all the hairs out of the way. Still, this is a small price to pay considering the fact that I am pain and embracement free after each shave. A great gift idea.",1197331200,0,0,0,0,1

1 As a hair dryer...This unit gets hot enough but not too hot. And, it drys my hair quickly.
STYLING: Just before it is fully dry, I use my hand to take the brush move in a circular motion for a fuller look. I lift the dryer up as I curl.
For a more curly look, I tuck the brush under just like it was a curling iron and leave it for about 10 to 15 seconds per curl.

2 DRY STYLING - I use this just like a curling iron, however, since I have dry hair, I place just a half dime sized to dime sized amount of VO5 and massage this into my scalp and hair BEFORE I style with this brush...this gives my hair a shiny, healthy look.
If you have oily or normal hair, just spray/spritz a tiny bit of water from a water spray bottle between shampoos to freshen/style...do this before your dry style. It only takes a very tiny amount of water for this.

3 Two levels...High and low. I use the High for brush drying and the Low for Styling.

4 I like thag there us an ON/OFF button on the plug area and also on the brush.

5 The quality of this is amazing, The brush/dryer is quiet.

6 The brush removes for easy cleaning.

7 The brush is tangle free in my hair, much better than a nylon bristled type.

Warming Hue -
I have several colors in the essie Gel line.
This one is one that is a very light shade of pink with almost white undertones to it.
Has a shimmer to it even without the top coat applied.
One thing for myself about this particular color is it was harder to get it just right on my nails.
Sometimes it seemed more translucent and in order to get enough coats had to be careful of strokes showing up.
The rounded brush helps to keep color where it needs to go and not all over the edges of your finger.
I have rather long nails and sometimes it takes a bit to get good coverage on them with these  lighter shades.
The color is still growing on me but I do like the essie brand over others I have tried.
It lasts on my nails much longer and is almost effortless to take off with nail remover.",1500422400,0,0,0,1,0

I have the finest of hair and all I do is moisturize my ends first, then all around the edges and then I part down the middle and do both sides and run my fingers from root the end all through the rest. I wait until it all soaks in and then I roll my hair at night.  When I wake up to style it, I run my oiled fingers through it again and it looks so glossy and feels so sleek and smooth, with NO HINT of being greasy what so ever.

- Adjustable neck strap (works on me and my 7 year-old son)

- Appears to be well made

~CONS~

And I wonder how many people get headaches, rashes, mental confusion, inability to breathe, etc., and don't realize that they actually have an allergy to perfumes, aftershaves and other scented products?

Revlon, the maker of Mitchum deodorant/antiperspirant, used to be an excellent company. But across the board they have started messing with products that used to be reliable. How foolish. And how very inconvenient for those of us who thought we had figured out what worked for us. Now I am finding strong stenches (fragrances are stenches to someone whose allergies are triggered by them) even in Revlon's rouges and lipsticks. I had my lips blister and peel due to one of them. Now they mark a deodorant that contains the effective ingredient I'm looking for, Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex Gly, ""unscented"" when in fact it contains fragrance.

I was introduced to the amazing Sugar Scrub in a spa and got this to sample more products.

You get these products in this sampler:

Body butter  --coconut  Has the great coconut scent in a softening skin butter formula.

Body Gel -- Dilorescue  great for sunburn, insect bits, irritations, rashes etc. Very cooling and soothing.  Contains a nut unique to the south Pacific islands as a healing soothing balm.

Coconut Creme Body Scrub -- this is still my very favorite of all of the products.  I've never appreciated a scrub that much before this.  This version is the creamey lotion but I want the Sugar Scrub in the jar.  These two do the same thing as far as making my skin the smoothest it's ever been. And the scent is amazing.  You can get this and most of the products in the scent of your choice and they are all amazing but the Mango is my favorite.

Hydrating Body Lotion -- Mango  I plan to get a big bottle of this.  It's fantastic and I can't get enough of this scent.  I've never experienced a mango scent before in products.

Nourishing Exotic Oil --White Ginger Lily  I love this also.  It's healing and smoothing.  The oil absorbs in ten minutes into the skin leaving it incredibly smooth.

Coconut Milk Shower Gel -- Starfruit  This scent is a close second in favorite of mine to mango.
As with all products in this line, it leaves skin almost unaturally smooth and silky.

Coconut Milk Shampoo -- soft shiney hair after using this wonderfully scented shampoo.l

Coconut Creme Conditioner -- Soft smooth silky hair that smells like coconuts.  Yummy.

There's no staining or spotting from this spray, which I wasn't sure would be the case since it does have a tiny bit of coloring added to it. Items that this is sprayed on dry quickly and without any sticky/tacky residue. I prefer this to aerosol versions personally, though it does cost more.

This is a unique, calming blend of essential oils that is guaranteed to create a tranquil, pleasant atmosphere wherever you may diffuse it. With a promise like that, how could I not run to test this product and see if it delivered?

I put 10 drops of the quality, thick oil into my diffuser and got to humidifying my space. Within roughly 10 minutes even though I was on edge all day due to annoying x-boyfriends, screaming children playing outside on the street and telemarketers that won't stop harassing me, my wind wandered to the far tropical reaches of Hawaii and brought immediate calm and wellness to my overall demeanor and presence.

The scents packed into this one magical vial are lavender (calm, stress relief), clary (Blood pressure regulator), Sage (Anti-inflammatory), Marjoram (calming), Petitgrain (relief from depression, anxiety and stress) and Ylang Ylang (relaxation). This creates the perfect blend of calming and soothing oil perfect to diffuse into your environment anytime you are feeling high strung. The aroma is woodsy, sweet and elegant all at the same time. This would be a great scent to keep in your library of essential oils or to gift to someone you know could use such a therapeutic, marvelous blend.

640,4,"11 11, 2015",A6P370Q9YB27F,B00021KD2C,"Derma E is a company, which specializes in a large array of skin care and beauty oriented products. The company focuses in effective ingredients and skips on the packaging, so the consumer pays more towards what is inside the bottle, versus what is outside of it! Derma E, is not limited to just ant-aging regimens and if you checkout their website. they have everything from sun care, hair and scalp, to wipes, mask, serums and anything to satisfy your skin care needs.  The company has a long history in making products with natural ingredients, which have always been Vegan friendly and Cruelty-Free.

I was sent a jar of their Anti-Wrinkle Vitamin A Retinyl Palmitate Crme, which is part of the Anti-Wrinkle Vitamin A Essentials line. Focused on aging skin and helping with cell rejuvenation via Retinyl.

Ingredients (as listed on the jar):
Purified Water (Aqua), Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Glycerin, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetyl Alcohol, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil, Helianthus Annus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A), Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Panthenol (Provitamin B5), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Allantoin, Cedrus Atlantica (Cedarwood) Essential Oil, Phenylethyl Alcohol, Vanillin, Carbomer, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin.

Verdict:
I tested out the product for 10 days to get an idea of how well it satisfied my skincare needs. The creme is thicker in texture than most products of like kind, however I noticed that if I use a small dab, not only does it cover the treated area well but its more than enough for treatment. I apply Retinyl only to the areas that I feel are my problem areas and because Retinyl palmitate tends to have an oily texture, I know to go light with application. Being a past Retinol user, my skin has also acclimated to any adverse effects and I no longer experience any sensitivity or redness from such ingredient.  I applied to where I suffer from fine lines, so I focused in the under eye area and forehead. The creme is smooth and does aid with softening the skin, which not only hydrates but protects well. With the mixed weather we have been experiencing from Autumn, the warmer days into cold nights tend to stress my skin out. The Dema E creme made sure to always keep that layer of protection present. Retinyl palmitate, is effective in the turn over process, meaning skin cells shed quicker and its almost speeding up the clock to be able to rejuvenate quicker and produce a newer layer of skin that appears more flawless. The Retinyl palmitate formula from Derma E is filled with antioxidants and a selection of oils to insure the user gets the best chance at recovering a more useful appearance. I did feel the creme was thicker of course than my serums but after 2 days of getting use to the amount I needed to accomplish full coverage, it then got easier estimating how much to get out so it would not affect my make-up. I was satisfied with the product because the claims made are true and this jar is not pricey, plus gives the user real results! The creme from Derma E has 10,000 I.Us, so its on par with the recommended amount for a user to experience results. The only con I have is the product coming in jar form, as I prefer tubes that keep fingers/nails away from the product but I do have a plastic spatula I use just for these type of containers. Other than that, I was happy using and testing a product that works and I know I can easily fit into my budget because its affordable.

I received the above product(s) free of charge from Derma E.  I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.  My review is based on my experience with the product and/or brand, which may differ from yours.",1447200000,0,0,0,1,0

Thankfully, a few years back I received a sample of Glide from the hygienist after a checkup. I could tell the difference immediately. As soon as I finished the sample I went out and bought a dispenser of Glide. I've been using Glide ever since. It slides easily between my teeth, even those where the spaces are tight. And it never breaks off while I'm using it. I plan on continuing using it for as long as I have my teeth (which, I hope, is until I die).

I am guessing that the other super food ingredients helps minimize the irritation that AHA can cause. A lot of these types of creams have chemicals in them and cost more! This is such a great price for such awesome ingredients.

Sprays on easily with a very handy 360 spray can that works from all angles including upside down.  Nice light feel.  No offensive scent.  Results?

On those oh-so-white legs, I was disappointed to see a hint of orange.  This is an important negative, BUT, I'm thinking the major problem here (regarding the orange hue) is that I was applying the medium/deep tinted product on very white skin.  I think I would have got more desirable results with the ""light to medium"" tint.  (Save ""the medium to deep glow"" shade for skin with already some color).  Realistically, I was just looking for enough color so as not to be embarrassed, I really wasn't trying for a well-tanned look.  The application did leave a nice sheen that looked reasonably healthy, and not flashy or ridiculous.  The glow combined with the color does indeed help camouflage pale and dimpled skin.  As I said, if you are working on pasty white areas, go with the lighter shade selection.  Hangs in there a couple of days, but will shower off.

Now, about the ""firming"" aspect. Felt great going on - nice and light.  I can imagine, I suppose,  some sensation of firming.  But even the manufacturer suggests, ""For best firming results, use every day . . . in conjunction with regular exercise, a healthy diet . . ."" (you get the picture).

Hyaluronic Acid helps the skin hold in more moisture; Vitamin C helps brighten and even skin tone. Together, they work magic and indeed are the best ingredients to fight signs of aging. This product leaves the skin feeling silky soft and really helps with diminishing the appearance of fine lines. The serum has worked well with my other facial products and  there is no conflicts in over application of ingredients or mixture of fragrances. My skin does not look quite as tired as before and it has continued to look better.

I love the pump dispenser because it is more sterile than taking it out of a jar or regular container. Aside from the convenience of its portability, after reading all of the benefits, I have been adding it to my daily routine and using it prior to my regular moisturizer. The great thing is that because it is so hydrating that I seem to use less of my regular moisturizer. The texture of this product is a clean feeling and lightweight gel. It goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly, and does not leave a greasy feel. The serum has no scent or artificial chemical fragrance which I prefer and a little of the product goes a long way. It takes two small squirts onto my finger to get a thin layer covering my face. Once it dries, it leaves my skin feeling absolutely refreshing. It is quite moisturizing as well, so it locks in all the water in my skin and gives it a supple feel all night long.

The serum takes a minute to dry and then I apply my makeup. My foundation goes on very smoothly over it and it seems like I have been applying much less makeup lately. It helps keep my makeup looking smooth and moist longer. I find it work better as a makeup prime than many premium brand makeup primers I have tried. My facial lines around my nose has even seemed less pronounced under my makeup. In just two weeks I have been using the serum, I have noticed that my skin tone has become more luminous and healthier looking. I have not seen any fading of sun spots that I have, but I am hopeful with long term use that they will eventually lighten up. Based on what my experience has been so far, I am confident that with consistency and patience, I will see more progress down the road. This is a wonderful wrinkle smoothing serum and I highly recommend it.

Eucalyptus works as an expectorant and helps cleanse your body of toxins and harmful microorganisms that can make you feel sick. One of the most effective ways to utilize eucalyptus for colds is to drop several drops of the essential oil into your diffuser before going to sleep so you can take advantage of the healing benefits all night long.

For more acute situations, you can make a steam bath by pouring a cup of boiling water into a bowl, and then mix 10 drops of eucalyptus EO, place a towel over your head and inhale deeply for five10 minutes.

A few drops eucalyptus oil with some coconut or olive oil gives your hair a nice moisturizing pick-me-up. This is especially great to ward off dandruff and an itchy scalp. Also, eucalyptus is used as a natural remedy for lice in replacement of chemical treatments.

Eucalyptus EO is an excellent cleanser to remove grease and grime from your workday and can rejuvenate sore hands and feet when mixed into your salt bath. Simply mix sea salt, epsom salt and eucalyptus oil to remove grease and dirt for good.
Not only does eucalyptus give a nice, fresh fragrance to your home products, but it adds vital anti-microbial properties as well. You cant go wrong putting several drops into pretty much everything: soap, laundry detergent, mop water, toilet cleaner, window cleaner  the list goes on.

Whether you're battling smelly shoes or a stinky dog bed, topically wash items to remove odors with a wet rag soaked in eucalyptus oil-infused water, and place outside to dry in the sun. This can prevent odors as well as keep the shape intact! You may also mix it with lemon oil or tea tree oil for an anti-stink spray.

Try putting a few drops into your vacuum and clothes dryer filters to freshen them up and sanitize them a little. Also, its great for killing mold in your home, and you can mix eucalyptus with other oils like clove and tea tree oil to cleanse the air and maintain a mold-free home.

Like lemon essential oil, eucalyptus oil is highly effective at removing spots on your carpet, clothes and basically every fabric you have in the house. It even works to get gum off your shoes! Make sure to test it on an inconspicuous place first just to make sure the oil doesnt react strangely with the material you treat.

Eucalyptus essential oil is highly effective for treating respiratory problems, such as asthma, bronchitis, COPD, pneumonia and even tuberculosis. Using eucalyptus for asthma is a proven treatment that dilates the blood vessels and allows more oxygen into the lungs. Simply mix eucalyptus oil, peppermint oil and coconut oil for a Homemade Vapor Rub, and put on upper chest.

Eucalyptus oil has antimicrobial and antiseptic properties that are effective at treating wounds, burns, cuts, abrasions, sores and scrapes. It also can be made into a salve or healing ointment and put on bug bites and stings. Along with acting as a natural pain reliever to the area, it also keeps the area from getting infected, which speeds healing.",1459987200,0,0,0,0,1

For some reason our teen boy thought he should use this cleanser  without a washcloth... AND apparently a washcloth is an extremely important part of getting the upper hand on breakouts.

The Backstory
Our boy is 14 and is having to begin shaving several times a week. (Somehow it doesn't seem right that our baby is shaving. sigh.)  This shaving is aggravating his breakouts taking them up a level.  We got this Clean & Clear Cleanser to see what results we could get with an over the counter product.  After a week and a half there wasn't (initially) enough improvement so we made an appointment with a dermatologist.

We've since CANCELLED that appointment because I happened to watch boy wash his face one night. No Wash Cloth.  I smacked my forehead and took the time to show him how to properly wash his face.  Apparently this is a thing guys don't all know.  It's been a week since the demonstration (which included a mention that you don't scrub your face fiercely. That the skin there is delicate, particularly under the eyes....)  and his face is looking really good.  I suspect in another few days even the small spots will be gone.

SUMMING IT  UP
This is working for us.  If you've got  younger teen using it, I highly recommend making sure that they know what they should be doing.  Don't assume they read the directions, even if they read everything else that crosses their path.

No irritation, easy to use, and the salicylic acid is working to make considerable changes in his complexion.",1487462400,0,0,0,1,0

Since hubby has assured me that my butt doesn't stink it's hard to say if this made a difference so I will only comment on what I do know for a fact and that is that Booty Fresh is odorless and although they need to find a different type of spray bottle that works from odd angles. it sprays on fairly easily and does leave your butt feeling softer, I assume that is from the aloe.  What concerned me about the product was that it said to not spray on genitalia, well that's easy enough but it definitely did leave me worried as to what would happen if some dripped in that direction especially considering you're supposed to spray and let it sit for 3 to 5 minutes - still scratching my head trying to figure out what position exactly would be optimal to achieve that.  I will say that I did use this under our toilet seat and it did help get rid of odors there so I guess that means it does work but let's be realistic here - Booty Fresh offers a 100% hassle free refund if it doesn't work but who wants to be that consumer who has to admit they have a really stinky but that not even a specialized product could neutralize.

Pros:
+ Low price
+ Mild abrasion
+ Runs on cheap AA batteries
Cons:
 - No storage case to keep everything together
 - Much slower than manual filing
 - Cheap construction
 - Feels like it could break at any time
 - No replacement files
My wife and I had such high hopes for this electric file.  We cut one of our 13 month old son's nails a little too close a few months ago and ever since that happened, he's terrified when we clip his nails.. Kicking, screaming, crying, and the problem is his nails grow at warp speed so once a week clipping is a must.  The good thing about this product is that he's not afraid of the gentle filing action.  But it feels like it could break any second.  The plastic doesn't feel solid.  The file head wobbles around like it might fly off with a gust of wind, and the on/ off bottom is junky.  Plus it comes with one set of files and then it's apparantly disposable so even at this great price, you're better off buying anything else

5056,4,"11 2, 2013",A3EFSLEMHNPP6A,B00CZH3FGM,"I give the Whitening Kit four stars because it worked as advertised- my teeth were noticeably whiter after application.  The MSRP of the kit value is also less than the sum of the retail values of the individual parts.  I've deducted one star because it caused tooth pain during usage.  Additionally, only a few elements of the kit are actually needed for whitened teeth.

First, a few thoughts.

- The Oral-B 4000 took somewhere between 24-48 hours to get a full charge!
  * I liked the brushing feature wherein the toothbrush stops during operation to remind you to switch quadrants.
  * Nice of them to include two extra brushing tips in the kit.

- The white strips worked noticeably better than the ones I last used.  They're a neater affair these days.
  * I no longer foamed at the mouth and took on the appearance of a rabid dog.

- You can probably achieve just as good (and cheaper!) results using only the white strips and the toothpaste.

***************************
USAGE LOG:

Day 1: I'm not a heavy coffee or tea drinker, but I did have some yellow stains on the lower portions of my teeth.  Started the kit in earnest, although I decided not to use the white rinse because I didn't like the after-taste.

Day 2: My teeth were already one shade whiter!  However, the Oral-B 4000 was causing tooth-root-pain so I switched to manual brushing with the whitening toothpaste.

Days 3 - 12: Used the white strips/manual brushing + whitening toothpaste.  Very pleased with the results.  Mild, but tolerable tooth pain.

Took a break for Halloween and consumed candy which may have set back some of my whitening progress.

Days 13 - 14: Teeth look much whiter.  Even the hard-to-reach-side-teeth look brighter as well, due wholly to the whitening toothpaste.

CONCLUSION: I think the entire kit is unnecessary.  It certainly worked as advertised, but you can achieve the same results with just the whitening strips + whitening toothpaste, without the whitening rinse and electric toothbrush.",1383350400,0,0,0,1,0

But this doesn't keep me from trying different possible products that might help even if they don't fully rid ""solve"" or eliminate cellulite altogether.  It's in this spirit that I tried out Dr Brandt's Cellusculpt.

The cream comes in secure packaging, carefully sealed to prevent it from spilling during transit. With product this expensive, it's good to know that it will arrive in good condition.  You only need a little bit of cream at a time, so I expect that the tube should last me several months with careful application.  I've been applying a pea size for each troublespot (each thigh and the backside).  It leaves a slightly cooling and tingly feeling which lasts for a bit.  I found that it makes me more conscious of the area as well, encouraging me to do more spot exercises, which is a good thing.  I haven't noticed any significant reduction in the cellulite in the week that I've used it. It compares well to the Estee Lauder Body Performance Slim Shape Anti-Cellulite Visible Contouring Cream that I'd used in the past. I'd say it is just as effective.",1423612800,0,0,0,1,0

The steam does a few things, it hydrates the hair but it also relaxes and lifts the cuticle so that products, like conditioners, can better penetrate. If you have longer hair, it's best to lift it up and pin it so it can benefit from the steam, especially the ends that tend to be them most damaged. This steamer is easy to set up (my 10-year old did it) and starts to work quickly. It is designed so that the steam is spread out around the hood and doesn't just shoot up to the top. I like that it has the ability to be a facial steamer as well because investing in this for just the hair steamer might be a stretch for some. Having both features is an added benefit.

These are the best exfoliating sponges and are honestly miracle workers.
When I used this konjac body sponges that is made out of 100% natural konjac root fiber I was nervous about what it would smell like. However, the scent is very mild and smells lightly like charcoal. I love the smell charcoal it reminds me of summer (charcoal grilling) so I don't mind this scent at all. In fact, after using it in the shower I didn't notice the smell on my skin when I got out. I was also worried about how rough it would be on my skin. Surprisingly, I found that after these sponges are soaked in water for one or two minutes they enlarge and soften. This sponge did not make me feel like my skin was be scrapped off instead it make it feel more like I was getting a gentle message. My skin was not irritated at all after use and I do have semi-sensitive skin. I did not use any cleanse on this sponge.
I love that these sponges do not contain preservatives or artificial fragerences and colors. I also love that they come with an attached string which is very convenient for drying them out after use.

The shaving peformance is fine for me -- not as close as a wet shave but that's a good thing for me personally because the closeness of wet shaves makes my face break out.  Every 3-7 years I buy a new Norelco and they get incrementally better each time.

I'm writing to warn about one feature.  Every shaver I'd had up to this one had a physical slider switch to turn it on and off.  This models has a push button.  This means you can't tell BY TOUCH whether it's on or off.  This is critical for me because I usually shave in the car (sitting in traffic) with the stereo blaring and I can't hear the shaver (especially since the newer models are pretty quiet).  I turn it on and off a lot as traffic conditions change.

Further, when the battery is low, my previous shavers would just run slower and slower until they came to a gradual stop.  This one slows slightly (imperceptably to me, really) and then just ""falls off the cliff"" and stops cold.  So you don't get any warning really that it's about to run out -- if I knew it was running down, then I'd shave a lot faster!

And this is where the tactile power switch feedback is important:  if the battery's totally drained, but I'm not done yet, I'll leave it off for a minute and then turn it on for 5-10 seconds of shaving before it dies again.  With the push-button power control this is really confusing because you're never really sure what's on and off.  It turns out the the power button is like a pulse that gets sent to an internal microcontroller (I'm guessing), so after it's been off for a while the power ""position"" doesn't matter, it's really off.  You just push to reboot the thing.

So, my 7825XL was robbed out of my car last night and I'm buying another one of these, so I guess that's an endorsement.  But I'm bumping up to the next higher model with better battery status indication ...",1108339200,0,0,0,1,0

But I also use ACT ... so, I am used to products that don't necessarily provide that exciting tingle (my dentist has me use Listerine in the morning and ACT before bed). So, I replaced my Listerine with this and while my mouth didn't feel as excitingly clean, it claims to protect enamel, so that might be a nice bonus.

After this bottle is gone, I plan on returning to Listerine (I supposed it is a part of my routine now ... and I am always loathe to deviate from the course of action my dentist plans for me). However, this seems to do no harm and could be great for those with a low-threshold for strong products like Listerine (there is a person in my family who does not use Listerine because they find it painful ... this would be ideal for her). So, if this is you, give it a try. (If you like it, then consult your dentist).",1443830400,0,0,0,1,0

After looking at all the models, we choose this one. It holds a lot of water. It has storage in the lid for all the attachments, and it seemed easy to use.

I looked at the ones that were battery powered but I didn't think they would hold enough water and I couldn't see him refilling it to finish. This model has a big range of pressure that changes quickly with the turn of a dial. it does have to be plugged in and the handle is connected by a water tube. This does limit the distance from the unit to the mouth but it is more than enough if you are standing at a vanity.

There is a huge variety of tips but I don't think we will be using more than two or three. I actually wish that there were two or three of the basic tips for multiple family members instead of some of the other fancy tips.

The tips pop on and off easily and there is a 'pause' button on the handle that allow you to shut the water spray off quickly. This way, you can turn it on, position it in your mouth and then start the water spray.

It is not a clean process. It is almost impossible to use this without splashing water at some point.

The bottom line is that it does what it promises and my son has been using it. We'll see how good his teeth are when the braces come off in two years...",1320537600,0,0,0,1,0

I'm seriously wondering what's wrong with them that I'm missing, because they hit the nail on the head when it comes to quality lip pencils.

Only one color is, to me, unusable--it's an orangey-red that I think would make anyone's teeth look very yellow.  The other colors are perfect!  Unlike most pencil sets, there aren't any that are too ""brown"" or ""yellow"" or ""orange"".  They are all lovely.

I am pretty conservative/neutral with my lip color but am trying to ""branch out"" a bit and use darker pigments.  None of these are so dark that they'd be inappropriate for a 45-year old woman like me.  They ARE very pigmented and go on incredibly smooth.  They don't stay on all day for me, but considering that they also don't dry my lips out, I'm okay with having to reapply once or twice.

The facial cleanser, like the beard oil, features a nozzle that dispenses oil pump by pump. This allows you to get what you need, without getting too much. It also prevents a mess, which I appreciate, since I am the one who has to clean the bathroom. *Smile*

The gold flecks are not glittery at all and they add just a touch of sheen.  I also have the Nars Multiple in Orgasm, which I use first, then I go over it with the Orgasm powder formula, which together, provide all day wear.  The Super Orgasm is a coral flecked with gold, more gold than the Orgasm but still subtle.  Coral is a universally flattering shade and is especially pretty with summer colors.  Even in the winter, it keeps me from looking sallow.  Although I'm light, but not fair, with hazel eyes and dark blond hair, Super Orgasm would be equally pretty on medium or olive skin or African American coloring.  The formula lasts all day without changing color or fading, so you won't need to touch it up.

My skin is oily but if you chose to use just the powder blush, it would be fine for normal or dry skin types.  I've had these Nars blushes for several years and have yet to put a dent in them.

Fortunately just as I came to that decision the many rave reviews for this eye cream & for the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PREMIUM-Eye-Cream-with-EGF-For-Men-Women-BEST-for-Puffiness-Dark-Circles-Wrinkles-0-5-Ounce-High-End-Formula-with-Epidermal-Growth-Factor-Caffeine-Anti-aging-Try-Risk-Free-Today/dp/B016AV93FU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PREMIUM Eye Cream with EGF ' For Men + Women ' BEST for Puffiness + Dark Circles + Wrinkles ' 0.5 Ounce ' High End Formula with Epidermal Growth Factor + Caffeine ' Anti-aging ' Try Risk Free Today!</a>&nbsp;which I also love made me glad I decided to give it one final attempt.

WHAT I HAVE FOUND THE IDEAL SOLUTION FOR MAXIMUM MOISTURIZING & ANTI-AGING BENEFITS THAT IMPROVE THE LOOK OF BOTH THE UNDER-EYE & EYELID AREA IS TO use the Valentia eye cream for the area below the eye.  That's because it has a very soft & delicate & wonderfully moisturizing texture that leaves that area looking & feeling great.  Then I apply the Acetyl eye cream to my entire upper eyelid area as its consistency is ideal for that & it doesn't run into the eyes in any way & it causes an immediate tightening effect which I found perfect for that area but I preferred the softer & more moisturizing impact of the Valentia cream for the under-eye area.  However, you can use either cream around the entire eye area but Valentia did recommend not going below the crease of the upper eyelid to avoid the risk of that cream running into your eye & I do find that works but I prefer how the Acetyl is able to handle the entire upper eyelid area.

I have to admit, I was skeptical on how well it worked and how often you would have to use the wraps to see a difference.

When it came in the mail, I couldn't wait to open it up and give it a try. This package of wraps comes with Four body wraps. You can use on your legs, back, arms or stomach area. There is instructions on the package of the wraps (individual) and there is pictures on the box and there is directions on the back of the box. This shows you where you can put the wraps on the body and how many wraps you would need. It is a one time application.

It's very easy to use, you simply make sure the area you are going to use it on is clean and dry. Then you simply place the wrap on your body. It sticks very well to your skin, be careful when your taking it off if you have sensitive skin. I seen a small difference from using this wrap twice (thigh area).

Here's what I'd want to know:

Does it clean well?  Yes.  I have oily skin, and this took the remains of the days off without leaving my skin tight.

Does it smell good?  Not really, but it doesn't smell bad either.  It's clean---but it doesn't appeal to me personally.

Is it a pleasure to use?  Yes.  It's a cream texture--and pea sized blob produces a lot of lather.  It seems to rinse well.  I don't look forward to using it because I don't love the smell, but it takes makeup off quickly.

Does it outperform drugstore level cleansers?  No.  I've used many face washes like this in the past.  It reminds me of the Neutrogena Naturals Purifying Cream Cleanser ($7.99 for 5oz) which I didn't love.  This cleanser is pleasant enough.....but it's not anything I would rush out to buy again.

I got all different colors ranging from brown nudes pinks and plum oh and one that could be paired with coral lipstick. A beautiful red as well!! These were a creamy consistency. They glide on your lips. No dragging or pulling. Yes you have to sharpen them but well worth it. These are extremely long pencils too!! I really love that I can experiment now with different color lipsticks. I got stuck in a nude color lipstick rut for a while. Now I can expand my horizons! These are wonderful pencils. I do love the nude same color as my lip the two pinks one a dusty rose also the color of my lip and hot pink which is a Barbie pink And a light nude brown which also just pops a little color on my lips. I am extremely pleased with the quality of these pencils. I have bought inexpensive lip liners and they tug across your lip ouch!! Not these!! I suggest if you want less touch ups a primer and a light dusting of your concealer powder on top then redraw the line. Works every time!!,1435017600,0,0,0,0,1

5394,5,"07 17, 2016",AYABRBZUMRLXQ,B00MFR3QJI,"This luxury face moisturizer for men is a no-nonsense, powerful facial hydrator and soothing after-shave lotion all in one.  It comes in a small (3.38 oz), slick, cool, professional metallic case (see photos), so it's small enough to fit nicely in any bathroom or travel bag.  The formula keeps your skin hydrated while fueling your face with amazing stuff daily.  Not only does it nourish, it also absorbs quickly and completely for a masculine matte finish without greasiness.  This moisturizer is free from phthalates, sulfates, synthetic dyes, parabens.  It's 100% vegan and cruelty free with no animal testing.  Their ingredients work to moisturize, heal, protect and visibly improve your skin's appearance all year round.  The key ingredients include: Aloe Vera which has strong healing and anti-inflammatory properties that soothe shaving and irritation and Argan oil which is used to hydrate and soften skin.  These are ideal ingredients to give skin a natural boost.  It's a popular choice for business executives and professionals.  It comes in a lockable dispenser with cap to protect it from messy spillage, which comes in handy while you're traveling.

Although there's something to be said for that weathered look that adds character, there's also something about a clean shaven man who prides himself in the smooth look no many strive to achieve.  The fact is, everyone ages - mean and women alike.  Our face loses elasticity as we get older.  This doesn't have to happen in your 30s.  Not to mention, natural 'weathering' can lead to nasty skin conditions and worst case scenario - skin cancer.  The only way to avoid this and look younger at the same time is to treat your skin well and this includes a regular (1-2 x daily) application of a good moisturizer.  Don't think of it as 'makeup'.  It's just a way to lock in moisture and protect from the elements.  The best part is it takes very little time and very little product to get the polished look you had in your 20s.

All it takes is a quick regimen that starts after you put your razor down in the morning.  After you shave, wash your whole face, pat it (don't rub it because this pulls at your skin) and grab this moisturizer and gently apply it from the forehead down.  Since it doubles as an after-shave lotion, it will soothe the burn that occurs after you shave.  I recommend applying it to slightly damp skin (so there's moisture to lock in), dot moisturizer around the key problem areas (forehead, cheekbones, jawline and neck) then gently massage it into your skin using circular motions.  Be extra gentle around your eye area - I recommend using your ring finger to gently pat it into the skin around your eyes.  That's all you need to do.  Simple and quick way to hold on to the skin appearance you absolutely love.

Remember, when it comes to getting your skin back to a younger look, there's very little you can do after the fact, so prevention is your best weapon.  Your skin, like your body, benefits from a positive lifestyle.  First and foremost, get enough rest, drink plenty of water, avoid prolonged sun exposure (ear a hat if you work outdoors), eat healthy food and take 1-2 minutes a day to add a moisturizer to combat the effects of daily living.  After all, you don't want to resort to Botox or face-lifts because they're unnecessary if you take preventative precautions from the beginning.

My son is only 16 years old, but like me, he has extremely sensitive skin.  Although I spend the money on face wash specially designed for men for him to use, he still has issues with dry flaky skin.  We have tried several men's moisturizers in the past, yet none of them worked to really clear up his skin.  When I was given the opportunity to review this product, I was hoping it would give him the result we've been looking for in other products.  I'm happy to say it has.  He's been using this product everyday for the last couple of weeks and we saw visible improvement after day two.  He no longer has the dry flaky skin he's been plagues with,m especially around his eyes.  Not to mention he's experienced no redness or irritation from the ingredients.  I recommend it for all skin types because it comes with a 100% satisfaction guarantee.  Either it works or you get your money back.

1 -- Lasts forever.  Been using it for 2 wks on my face and neck and haven't even put a dent in it.

2 -- Skin ""feels clean"" and looks good.  I have super-sensitive skin and this has kept that at bay (and didn't add to it).

Only surprise to me was scent.  It's there but it's tame.  I'd say it smells more like soap with a hint of coconut than the other way around.  I think it's a great balance and I'm not sure I'd want a strongly-scented coconut soap even with my affinity for all things coconut but wanted to make sure others were aware.

This rose water facial toner is rather simple and as it is. Upon waking up from a nap, I suddenly had an urge to try the rose water that came in on the same day even though I was planning for another day.

There are total of 6 ingredients on the list;
- Aloe
- Rose (distilated)
- Glycerin
- Phenoxyethanol
- Tetrasodium EDTA

The toner is transparent in color just like water and smells like parfum. It does smell like rose however but not the way roses actually smell, therefore I think that they have added some sort of fragrance, etc. Not listed however.

As for my experience with the toner, I applied it on my face with the help of a piece of cotton which was on the directions. The toner felt very cool and refreshing on my face. I am rather neutral about the scent because it is not too strong if you apply just a little bit on your face with a piece of cotton or tissue is fine. It is very hot today, hitting almost 90 degrees ;<
There was no irritation or discomfort on my skin therefore I feel safe. I do have sensitive skin and I feel that this is a good facial toner for people with sensitive skin.

558,4,"08 17, 2005",ABLOQZIL42W7I,B0000C4KJV,"As any dental health professional will attest to, flossing one's teeth is just as important as brushing, and perhaps more so, for the bacteria that causes gum disease (and to a certain extent cavities) almost always starts between the teeth. Daily flossing breaks up the film of harmful bacteria and allows it to be removed.  Therefore, as a dentist, I am always stressing the importance of daily flosing to my patients.  My advice is this:

1.  Choose a floss that is comfortable to you and is the right thickness for your teeth.  Some people prefer floss holders rather than wrapping the floss around the fingers, while others prefer thin flavored floss to waxed thick floss. There are so many options - choose the right one for you.

2.  Waxed floss is ""waxed"" to allow easier passage between the teeth.  Waxed floss is no more effective than unwaxed at removing the bacterial film build-up. The important thing is to floss!

3.  Floss once daily, preferably before brushing.  Flossing breaks up the film of bacteria between the teeth in areas a toothbrush cannot reach.  It is important to then brush the teeth and rinse between the teeth to remove the film of bacteria that the flossing has dislodged.  Without brushing or rinsing after flossing, the bacteria can reattach to the teeth.

4.  Try to tie in flossing with another habit, such as watching the 10 PM news.  I know it sounds strange, but incorporating flossing into another habit leads one into developing a new habit.  Some complain that they don't have time to floss; well, if flossing is tied into another habit, such as watching TV, both can easily be done concurrently.

5.  There are many gimmicks the manufacturers use to sell their particular brand of floss.  Some flavor the floss, some incorporate fluoride into the strands of floss, and some make their floss more slippery for folks with tight contacts.  Whatever the case, the most important point is to choose a floss variety you will use regularly.  It is the mechanical act of removing the bacterial flim that is the important part, not the flavoring or chemical additions to the floss.

6.  If you want to keep your teeth for a life-time, develop the flossing habit.  As one wise sage said: ""If you ignore your teeth, they will eventually go away"".

I recommend this product, but it must be used regularly to be effective.

Every little girl loves to have their hair look pretty and most of them love to wear hair bows.  My daughter has really gotten into wearing different hair bows in her hair when she goes to school.  Sometimes my husband does her hair in the morning when i'm not there and lets face it, he isn't the best when it comes to that.  These flower hair clips are so cute and you get so many different colors and they are easy to put in the hair, so easy that my husband has no issues with these.

You get 10 flower hair clips and each one is a different color.  The colors are very vibrant and pretty.  They have the alligator clips on the bows, so you don't have to mess with clasps or anything(those other clasps are hard for my husband to deal with, she loves the alligator clips).

You can put the hair up in a ponytail, braid or up-do and just clip this in.  They don't fall out of the hair, and my daughter being a 6 year old that loves to play comes home with these still clipped in her hair.  I completely recommend it and think they are really cute in my daughter's hair.

While they don't have severe acne, they usually have a few blemishes they're battling at any given time. I'm always on the lookout for the best OTC product to help treat these minor break-outs.

This cream has a lot to recommend it. There's Benzoyl peroxide at 2.5% which is the effective recommended dose that doesn't further damage your skin, tea tree oil for it's antibiotic properties, retinol palmitate for cell turnover, glycerin for moisture retention, hydrocortisone as an anti-inflammatory, and glycolic acid and lactic acid to help clear away dead skin cells. Theres' no drying alcohol in it either (isopropyl, SD or denatured).

Ingredients: Benzoyl peroxide, Purified water, Glycolic acid, Cetyl alcohol, Glyceryl sterate, Ceteth-20, Steareth-20, Caprylic Capric triglycerides, Prunus amygdalus (sweet almond) oil, PEG-23, Glyceryl Distearate, Dimethicone, Stearyle alcohol, Lactic acid, Benzyl alcohol, Caprylhydroxamic acid, Tea Tree oil, Glycerin, Hydrocortisone, Benzalkonium chloride, Tetrahexydecyl ascorib acid, Tocopheryle acetate, Retinol Palmitate.

The cream has a thin lotion like consistency and it disappears once it's on the skin and it's easy to use a thin layer of product. It comes in a generous 2 oz jar. I love the size but I don't like the jar format. I would have much preferred a tube. There's also a prominent scent of tea tree oil.

One of my daughters though it was too irritating. The area she put it on turned red and she said it stung. As a veteran of anti-aging creams, my guess is the glycolic acid (2nd inactive ingredient) irritated her somewhat sensitive skin. She didn't want to use any more which was fine. However, my other daughter loves it. She's been using it for a few days and experienced only mild stinging. Her existing blemishes look much reduced and her overall complexion looks brighter. Her skin is also not getting overly dried out which has been a problem in the past. I think this is an effective acne treatment but those with sensitive skin should probably go slow when trying it.",1470268800,0,0,0,1,0

When it came in, my husband was doubting it would be as good as the one we have- we have a good one with brass fittings that we've thought was great - but he took it outside and this one is every bit as good - it is easy to turn, click-locks into place for the different settings, sprays exactly the way it should, and does NOT leak.  This one has a more comfortable handle though, and an overall sturdier construction.

The main thing I have to have a nozzle like this for is the fine mist for misting seeds.

I love the body lotions, the scrubs and now I have veered onto the shower gel addiction, since I had a sample of the Strawberry Lemonade lotion, and it smelled insane, I knew that showering in that scent would be even better.

There are no harsh ingredients and not stabilizers, waxes and chemicals, every product is 99% vegan and smells like summer. This shower gel is very thin and  watery but when I use scrubbing gloves in the shower or a loofah, there is no issues, as it foams up beautifully and  leaves the skin smooth and greatly scented. The smell itself is the best part, tangy lemonade and juicy red berries marry into a mouth watering cleanser that makes me feel like standing under a waterfall of summer. The bright and mouth watering luminous scent is amazing, and makes me want to wake up in the morning and get ready for another day. Sometimes it smells so good, I wish it was drinkable, as the scent is too real for words.

What I wasn't expecting was that my hair would feel so wonderfully soft and full after the first wash! It lathered beautifully with just a dab of shampoo, rinsed easily and without being fly-away or unmanageable at all, my hair is really so soft. I'm kinda stunned. (As I always do, I rubbed actual coconut oil on my hands and then ran my hands through my hair before blow-drying. But I've always done that. My hair has never felt this good so it isn't because of the light coconut oil finish.)

This cream doesn't really smell anything like coconut oil, but more like a clean baby -- I don't know why.

I like the feel of the very fine grit on my face.  I am of the opinion that from the moment I apply it, to the moment I remove the last smug of it from my face:  It is working.  Believing what I read about the mineral content of Dead Sea mud and the documented results of the skin tests that have been conducted over the years, I also believe that this mud mask is working beyond the time I remove it from my face.

I can feel the ""zing"" of the action of the minerals on my skin.  I can feel a tingle and a sweet heat on the more delicate areas of my skin..

When I rinsed it off, I worked the mud with its fine, sandy, abrasiveness, into my skin in areas that usually cause me problems:  On my cheek bones, in the hollow underneath my cheek bones, and on the sides of my mouth and in the area between my lower lip and chin.  I am sure it sloughed off some dead skin--I saw it.

When I patted my skin dry, I noticed that my pores were very tight.  That is a good thing.  Then I patted on my witch hazel toner and then my favorite stem cell serum (also from Elrique).

Minerals in the Deep Sea mud are absorbed into the skin while it is on my face, so I leave it on for a good 25 minutes.  (In Coastal Texas, humidity prevents the mud from totally drying and cracking.)  The minerals in the mud stimulate blood circulation.  I've read that documented testing proves that the mud helps with acne and psoriasis.  Magnesium in the mud helps hydrate the skin  and reduces inflammation.  Amazingly, the mud also lessens the depth of wrinkles.

If you've ever tried shaving your groin with a straight up razor you know how impossible it is to get a good clean look without at least some kind of irritation and hideous bumps.  The bodygroom is my savior!  Before the ceremony took hours of delicate precision, with this bad boy I can brush my teeth, talk on the phone, shampoo my hair, and shave my sack at the same time!  I've never experienced any kind of razor burn or nicks from using it, and I've explored the boundaries and took them to the limit! It even reduces the itchy feeling to almost nothing!

Other than the groin, I enjoy using my norelco for the old arm pits, weird nipple hairs, and anywhere else unwanted hair might grow.  It's tough stuff, not a jungle in sight that it can't take down.

Now even with all this praise I don't know that I should recommend it or not, as I just discovered they released the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Philips-Norelco-BG2030-Professional-BodyGrooming-System/dp/B001E0C9LI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Philips Norelco BG2030 Professional BodyGrooming System</a>&nbsp;that might actually be better.

Sure, it gives a close shave, but I have to go over and over and over the same spot to get it. And there are still hairs on my neck that it just can't cut. I've had the 1050 for about 3 months now. Just over 3 years before I was given a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Norelco-SpeedXL/dp/B001AMRQ2W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Norelco SpeedXL</a>&nbsp;and loved it. It cut quickly and did a good job. Unfortunately it wore out and the only one of the blades still cuts. So I got this new razor hoping that it would be even better than the XL. It does contour to the face really well, but it just doesn't cut my stubble easily. More than a day or two and it has a VERY hard time. And forget the tiny trimmer, it is just too hard to use. I go back to the one on the XL if I want to trim my sideburns or nose hairs. The 1050 holds a charge for a while and does clean fairly easily but you have to do it after every one or two shaves or it gets harder to get a good shave.

I like rotary shavers and have used them most of my adult life, but this one is a let-down, especially for the $130+ price. I would seriously consider trying a Phillips or Braun foil razor the next time around, given the reviews I've read. On a final note, the stand is a bit flimsy and tips easily, and the plug is a bit large, but those are minor considerations. If you want a good, close shave that doesn't irritate, I wouldn't make this the first on your list.

UPDATE: This razor has gone from bad to worse. It sometimes takes up to 10 minutes to finish a shave. The blades aren't dull since there is no pulling, but it just doesn't want to cut. I clean and maintain it meticulously so that is not the issue. This is a good looking razor, but that is about it. I cannot recommend it to anyone at this point.

I had high hopes for this bag of lavender from Pre de Provence, but I have to admit that I was a little disappointed. Lavender should have a fresh scent and a nice purple color. The range of purple can vary between varieties, but should never be dull and gray.  I took a photo of this lavender next to a tin of lavender I bought a few months ago from Fairview Lavender Farm in Kentucky, and you can see a huge difference. The scent is also fresher in the tin than in the bag from Pre de Provence. I have ordered bulk dried lavender blossoms from Provence and it's not always as nice as domestic lavender, but it's rarely this dull.

That said, the scent is nice and it will work well in a loosely covered dish or sachet where appearance doesn't matter as much.

The product comes out as a pretty malachite green, with a nice, fresh smell. You massage it onto clean, wet skin, and the directions said to let it sit for up to two minutes. It feels a little warm, but not unduly so; there are those little microbeads so many skin treatments have nowadays.

My skin is hardy, so I let it stay on my skin for five minutes before I rinsed it off.

Wow...just wow! My skin looks phenomenal, and it feels as smooth as a baby's bottom.

At a certain point I eliminated alcohol from my life and since that substance is absorbed on the tongue, I went in search of mouthwashes that did not contain it. This rinse is not emblazoned with the ""Alcohol Free"" claim (it is there in fine print); the ingredients do not list alcohol. My bottle gives the ingredients as: Active ingredient - Cetylpyridinium chloride 0.1%; Inactive ingredients - water, glycerin, hydrogen peroxide, flavor, sucralose, poloxamer 407.

Since I like the idea of a whitening mouthwash that can help me combat the inevitable coffee staining, I had been using Crest 3D White, which is alcohol free but which a lot of reviewers don't like because of its hydrogen peroxide. Some of those people have complained that it made their teeth - or maybe gums - sensitive.  So I have compared the two.

I like this Crest Pro-Health Clinical Oral Rinse better. My mouth feels cleaner. And I do have a couple of tooth/gum problems that it seems to help with. I have used the two interchangeably for comparison purposes. I use this daily, or I should say nightly before bed, following thorough brushing and flossing. Just think of the millions of bacteria it kills, that can't etch your teeth with their acid.

With this rinse, I do notice sensitivity of gums and/or teeth when rinsing with clear water after use. I do that because there is some theory that hydrogen peroxide should not remain in the mouth. The sensitivity, which is certainly akin to pain, is not sufficiently severe to make me stop using the rinse.

This Popcorners Kettle Popped Corn Chips combine all four wants into one light chip with great texture. The texture is kind of a bubbly, quilted texture which enhances the chips' appeal.

The kettle flavor is just the right amount of sweetness to me so it's not overpowering, yet you can taste a bit of saltiness, too. And the chips are fairly healthy, as they are lowfat, low sugar and low salt.

Ingredients listed on bag: enriched Yellow Corn {Yellow Corn, Niacin, Iron, Thiamine Mononitrate, Riboflavin, Folic Acid}, Sunflower Oil, Sugar, Sea Salt. The oil used is a healthy oil and like the use of sea salt instead of regular salt.

These are air popped with real corn. One bag has 140 calories and is low sodium (110 mg or 5% DV) and low sugar (3g), so they are relatively guilt-free. There are no artificial additives or preservatives and they are gluten free. This kettle is one of my favorite flavors and the only sweet flavor they make. I like the sea salt, too which tastes like salted popcorn.

Great to serve at a party for something a little different.",1458777600,0,0,0,0,1

After charging it the first time, which takes about 3 hours, you simply unplug it and put the plug cover on to protect it from internal water damage.  The facial cleansing side allows you to turn on the sonic pulsing while you use your favorite facial cleanser to wash away makeup, dirt, and pollution to leave your skin soft, smooth, and, most importantly, clean.

The other side allows you to gently massage your face and neck to stimulate blood flow and gently massage fine lines and wrinkles away.  The pulsing can be gentle or more rigorous to suit your mood or desire.  Because it's made with silicone, the BeneU Facial Cleaner and Massager is easily cleaned and won't harbor unsafe bacteria and germs.  I found that it left my face feeling really soft and smooth.

I washed it before using it, simply because I wanted to, not that it had a strange odor or anything like that.  This brush is a bit large for close work but for applying highlighter powder to the top of my cheekbones, it works perfectly.  I ordered another one prior to receiving this one but when the package came, I accidentally cut off half the bristles.  I think I paid about $4 for that one but when I went to reorder it, the price had gone down by more than half.  I have a lot of very expensive brushes so I was pleasantly surprised at the nice quality of this brush.  I wasn't looking for anything fancy and this brush does the job beautifully.  It picks up just the right amount of powder and once I tap off the excess, the exact amount is left on the bristles.  It also washes nicely with baby shampoo.  It also doesn't shed at all, which is weird for such an inexpensive brush.  I look forward to using it regularly.  If you need a medium size fan brush, this is a great one and a real steal.

It is a very hydrating and nourishing cream that leaves skin soft and supple and moisturized all day long.  As with a lot of the other Living Nature products this one has all natural Active Manuka Honey Totara Extract which help promote moisture, nourishment and fight off skin-ageing free radicals!
However, if you have oily or combination skin this might not work as a day cream but I would highly recommend it for dry skin.

I have used both the patchouli and the lemon soaps. These soaps are unique in that they can be assembled like Lego blocks so that there is a pumice (exfoliating) side and a nourishing, super-fatted, moisturizing side. The pumice side is gentle, and can be safely used even over bony areas such as the collarbone without irritating sensitive skin. The moisturizing side is beyond compare for its qualities. When you use it, it doesn't feel like it all rinses off - be assured that it does, that sensation is just the extreme moisturization taking effect! Afterward, my skin feels smoother, more moisturized, and silkier for the rest of the day. This wonderful texture increases with just a little additional everyday moisturizing lotion, but it really is due to the soap.

Don't let the price tag fool you. This soap is just incredible, and I really never thought I'd say this, but it's worth the cost!

Additionally, this gift box is so lovely, truly a beautiful presentation, with the soaps, which are over wrapped, enclosed in elegant sleeves with hand-tied black satin ribbons. For a lovely, unique, and beneficial gift, this is an outstanding choice! The pricing reflects a substantial savings over the individually packaged pricing, too.

I used very wet hands, just a bit of scrub and not too much pressure.  It's great:  Not too harsh/particles not too large or sharp; fragrance is un-assuming and very pleasant, and my skin feels so soft, with great buoyant texture after I've rinsed and patted dry.

I don't feel the need to use it more than a few times a week--definitely not every day.  When I do use it, I still feel the need to use my usual Deep Clean facial gel cleanser.  Always looking for a way to speed things up and get in and out of the shower quickly, I happened to hit upon a practice that seems to work superbly for me:  Now, when I feel the need for a bit of scrub--when my gentle gel cleanser needs a boost--I wet my face and my hands, dip out a bit of this scrub, then pump my gel cleanser on top of it.  I work it all onto my face together.  Pretty amazing results, and just what I need a few times a week.

7561,5,"02 1, 2014",AY12DBB0U420B,B00BPPITEI,"Many years ago, I was a  runner. I used to race every weekend and I've completed 11 marathons with a best time of 3:27. I finally gave up marathoning at about the age of 50 because of recurring sore ankles. I continued running for  another 20 years but finally gave it up altogether at about the age of 70. The problem was sore ankles, particularly the left ankle. Those ankle problems continue until today and I'm now 77.

The ankle problems are no big deal and I'd do the whole thing over if I had the chance. I take some minor pain medications when they act up. One of my favorites has been Bengay Pain Relieving Cream. It helps.

A couple weeks ago, I slipped on a stairs and gave my left ankle a good  twist. Now, it really hurt and the Bengay didn't seem to help much. I was mentioning this to my Mother-In-Law (from Russia) and she  suggested Alezan Cream For Joints, a product from Russia. Okay, I decided to try it when I discovered it was available on Amazon.

The Alezan Cream is sorta like the Bengay in that it comes in a plastic tube, I put a little on a hand and then rub it in to my sore ankle. Afterwards I put a sock on that leg to control the Alezan over night. Acually, I have no idea if this is the correct way, in that the Alezon comes only with explanations, cautions and instructions in Russian. Such is life.

I'm really surprised that I've had excellent results, much better than with Bengay. The next morning, my ankle is pain free and walking  around on it was much  easier. What a relief! I can't imagine that a topical salve,  such as this,  does the damaged interior any good, but it certainly makes it feel a lot better. I plan to continue until my ankle feels better and then keep a supply around in case I ever injure it again.

I have some artificial flowers so I wanted to see if I could put a little bit of the Ylang Ylang oil on them to make them have the floral scent so whenever I'm around them I can smell them and feel like I have real flowers next to me. I put a couple drops on a cotton ball and ran it over the artificial flowers and surprisingly it worked!

This Ylang Ylang Oil comes in a 4oz bottle which will last for a long time for me personally anyways. It also comes with a glass dropper so you can get the right amount of oil without wasting it. I would definitely recommend this Ylang Ylang Oil By Pure Body Naturals!

My intentions were to order this oil for my husband but upon its arrival and reading the ingredients I found that they were all natural oils and consisted of those that I use for my hair oil & moisture treatments! The oil contains a combination of (4) four natural oils; jojoba oil, sweet almond oil, sunflower oil, and grapeseed oil.  Purchased separately the oils are expensive and all are known for softening, moisturizing, and sealing in moisture for hair and hair follicles. After I shampooing my hair I conditioned and used Benjamin Jacob's oil as a sealer. I was pleased with the results and very happy to have found an oil mixture set at such a reasonable price!!

Once I did the research on triclosan I was suitably cautioned as well as kind of confused: if this triclosan is so awful why is it the number one ingredient of anti microbial, antiseptic hand washes in hospitals? OK, maybe it need not be added to mouthwash and maybe it really should be kept away from small children and babies but you can't just take it away and not replace it with something as equally effective! That is what the ""Greenies"" and the ""It Causes Cancer!"" throngs have effectively done, I guess.

All around Lotus WAS one of my favorites, but when I started to reorder I saw comments that the company has changed the formula and that it is no longer organic and may even contain lead. Lotus is also much higher priced than this E.l.f product (I paid the"" add on"" price of just over $2). I thought, ""I can't beat that price, even it turns out I don't like it."" For the price I probably should give it 5 stars but I'm not fond of this color, it is rose as it states but it is much lighter than I expected. I also think I'll have to apply it frequently. It feels GREAT on though. It's very moisturizing. I will try another color, hopefully one that is darker. I like the ""coffee"", deep burgundy colors better. I kinda knew from the picture that I might think this one was too light for my liking so I'm not complaining just giving my honest opinion. I want to say that I love it, but I honestly can't. Maybe I'll love the next color (which I will try), but even then it'll have to prove to have better staying power before I'll be able to say I love it. :-)  As a side note: Burt Bees shimmer lip balm is another favorite, when I find the right color, in part for it's staying power.

My reasons are twofold. First, this soap lathers up quickly and thoroughly cleans my body without leaving a film. Second, this is the only soap I have tried that does not leave a ring in a shower or bath.

It's lightly scented, but not in an obnoxious way, and the formula seems to have undergone over minor changes over the years. I have relatively sensitive skin and this has never caused any reaction. Some soaps I have used do cause minor skin irritation, which is yet another reason why I am loyal to this brand.

Now for the back story - my first encounter with Zest came when I reported to Navy boot camp in February 1967. The first thing we were told was to throw away the soap we brought with us and purchase Zest. The reason was this was the only soap back then that did not leave any residue, making it a little easier to achieve the spit and polish look for the showers when inspection time came around.

I also wrote a review on Norelco Spectra Razors.  Recently, I received a Norelco Cool Skin for my Birthday.  I have never really enjoyed a wet shave until I got this Razor.  Guys, you have got to try this Razor.  I'm telling you, this is the absolute best Electric Razor Norelco makes.  It does exactly what Norelco says it does: It shaves as close as a blade.  This is the closest and best shave that I have ever gotten with a Norelco Electric Razor in nearly 25 years of shaving!!!!!  I have a heavy, thick, dark beard and unlike with the Spectra, I don't even get a shadow in the afternoon.  I own a Spectra 8894XL Top Of The Line  Norelco Electric Razor.  Spectra 8894XL can't even come close to giving me the shave that I get with the Cool Skin Electric Razor.  The Spectra takes me 7 or 8 minutes to shave and it's still not as close as the Cool Skin and I shave with the Cool Skin in half the time.  This Electric Razor really is Blade Close.  It does have one con and that is the lotion dispensing system.  It does not put out much gel while you are shaving.  Its best to use some Edge Shaving Gel with this electric razor to really get a close comfortable shave.  I would like to say congatulations to Norelco: You Guys have finally made an electric razor that shaves as close as a blade.  In a pinch, I will still use my Spectra 8894XL, but in the mean time I'm sticking with my Cool Skin.  It leaves your  face feeling smooth and it really gives you a  smooth, close, comfortable shave.

This means you have to either have a chair that can be raised or lowered, or you have to somehow move the entire unit so that it is placed just right. 2) the water reservior holds only enough water for about a 20 minute treatment, I think it could have been larger.

Negatives out of the way, I really like this ""spa at home"" device. A product like this is what some salons would use for either facial steaming or for hair treatments. The O3 (ozone) feature really puts this in the professional realm. You don't have to have it on, but it is there via a separate button. It is hard to judge, but O3 is supposed to help whatever treatment that has been applied to the hair 'soak in' more effectively. For the face, it just feels and smells good, especially if you add a drop or two of an essential oil like tea tree. Once you get the right height, the product is easy to use. You can fill it via the back dispenser or by removing the cup in the front. Afterwards, just wipe it all down after use and empty any remaining water. The warning tone when the session is over is a bit annoying, but just shut the unit off and it disappears. The Ivation 2-in-1 Tabletop Hair & Facial Steamer W/ozone is a great product for those who want the salon experience at home.

After looking at all the models, we choose this one. It holds a lot of water. It has storage in the lid for all the attachments, and it seemed easy to use.

I looked at the ones that were battery powered but I didn't think they would hold enough water and I couldn't see him refilling it to finish. This model has a big range of pressure that changes quickly with the turn of a dial. it does have to be plugged in and the handle is connected by a water tube. This does limit the distance from the unit to the mouth but it is more than enough if you are standing at a vanity.

There is a huge variety of tips but I don't think we will be using more than two or three. I actually wish that there were two or three of the basic tips for multiple family members instead of some of the other fancy tips.

The tips pop on and off easily and there is a 'pause' button on the handle that allow you to shut the water spray off quickly. This way, you can turn it on, position it in your mouth and then start the water spray.

It is not a clean process. It is almost impossible to use this without splashing water at some point.

When I was approached to review this the company was more than willing to give me as much time as I needed to properly use and review this product and that really impressed me so I decided to give it a shot.

Ive had a big problem with under eye circles and bags lately due to my erratic sleep schedule and other issues.  I don't have a huge problem with wrinkles or crows feet yet, but any improvement with the dark circles under my eyes was going to be a plus for me.  Ive been using this product for approximately 4 weeks.  I try to use it in the morning and at night, but Im not the best at removing my makeup, so its really been more in the morning.

I took three pictures, one at the beginning, one half way, and one today  I definitely feel like theres been significant improvement with under eye puffiness and dark circles.  Im definitely using less concealer than before, and I feel like my under eye area is tighter than it was before.

I did not think I needed anything else for my baths. Turned out, I was wrong. I tried bath bombs because they were offered at a discount and was immediately hooked. Unlike bath salts, bath bombs moisturize your skin during bath and take your bath experience to the next level. But not all bath bombs are the same.

Spa Glo bath bombs are ones of the best. They moisturize the skin wonderfully due to their shea butter and cocoa butter content. They smell awesome!  I could not even pick which one I like the best, they are all great!  I usually do not care a lot for the visual effects of the bath bombs, like vivid colors and glitters but I realize that for other people these might be important. The packaging of Spa Glo bath bomb sets are the prettiest that I have seen. I just love the handmade glittered tulle bow with a sparkly heart. My severely autistic son who does not play with toys quickly got the hold of them from both Spa Glo sets, pink and blue. And the sets were wrapped in a pretty tissue paper.

638,5,"03 25, 2009",A1WX42M589VAMQ,B00021DJ32,"Some of the colors look scary in the compact because they are so highly pigmented. Exhibit A, for example, is a bright clownish looking orange-red that surely has scared off many a gal. But for those who know how to use a blush brush properly (ie, high quality bristles, good construction, a judicious amount of pressure, good blending), these babies pay off. And I mean pay off not just in beautiful color, but in how long they last, because this quality and pigmentation means you don't need to use a lot. One of these can last you a long, long time, even with daily use.

I have Exhibit A, Torrid, Taos, Crazed, Luster, and Mata Hari, which covers a range of warm and cool tones. Exhibit A is my fave go to red blush. Using just a touch of my duo-fibre MAC brush on it (ie MAC 187 brush), this deposits a beautiful, face-brightening blush to the cheeks. Too much and you look like Bozo, so this does require restraint.

Mata Hari is a lovely, feminine, cool pink-rose tone that I, who have olive skin, can wear and look like I was out walking briskly. Those two are my fave ones from NARS as they are matte. The others have some shimmer and require even more care in application and go well with a shiny gloss on the lips.

Luster is more like a highlighting color for me (it's a goldeny-lustrous color on me). It's pretty much the color of my skin with shimmer, so I can put it on without a color payoff, but it gives a nice glow that I like for days when I look ""tired"". A perking up thing. Also nice for adding glow when going out at night/to a party. On a lighter person, it's probably a nice warmth on the cheeks, sort of like a subtle bronzer. Could probably highlight eyes, all over, too. It's versatile.

Crazed is a deep raspberry pink with shimmer (ie, a cooler color that has glowiness). Taos is like a somewhat warm deep rosed-up red. It's a color that will definitely suit darker tones, but can be used by fairer women with much restraint. Torrid is a gorgeous deep peachy sort of tone with shimmer. I'm wearing it today with Manhunt by NARS (lipstick) overlaid with Red Devil coral-red gloss by MAC. Torrid is not as deeply-intense as Crazed or Taos, but it's not a shy color either. Will give a nice payoff.

I'm med-dark olive toned (NC44 in MAC) and all those look fine on me. I'm ordering Gilda to add to the peachy colors in my blush collection (which right now includes two MAC peachy tones and one by Physician's Formula). With summer coming in, I'm looking for peachier/warmer tones.

These are expensive-ish, but these are top-notch, and it's no wonder makeup artists and celebrities love NARS blushes. (Note: I don't own the much-touted, much-beloved, nearly legendary Orgasm, though, which is more suited to ligther-than-me gals, but it really is pretty in the pan. I have heard good things about Super Orgasm colorwise, if you don't mind having chunks of glitter fall off your brush.)

UPDATE: I got my Gilda blush and it's lovely. A soft-textured, nicely-pigmented matte peach that will look fabulous with peachy-coral and more orangey glosses for Spring and summer, or even with nude glosses.",1237939200,0,0,0,0,1

The water reservoir is large enough so that I do not run out of water after a minute or so of use.  The lid pops open to store the tips.  The only real design issue I have identified to far is that removing the top to fill the reservoir with water often results in the tip storage bin to pop open spilling the tips all over the sink.  They need to consider putting a better latch on the storage bin.  The irrigator has a button to cut off water without turning the device off.  Nice touch.

1527,5,"06 30, 2008",A35LMHYDT1ZR5Y,B000G8LWZI,"Quickly approaching (a still, sadly, rather vain) age 40, I have personally spent a small fortune over the years trying to slow the aging process and reverse the effects of too many days spent gardening without sunscreen.  I cannot even begin to list all the products I've somewhat foolishly gambled on to get my skin looking better.  This product--and several other products offered through the company NEOTERIC (all under the Alpha Hydrox brand)--are exactly the answer I've been looking for.  I've used them both alone and in conjunction with a more expensive brand of anti-aging products (for which I've also left good reviews on this site), and I can see great improvements both ways.

I decided to try this brand of alpha hydroxy cream after reading in Dr. Oz's (and Dr. Roizen's) book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/You-Staying-Young-The-Owner-s-Manual-for-Extending-Your-Warranty-You/dp/0743292561/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">You: Staying Young: The Owner's Manual for Extending Your Warranty (You)</a>.  I'd tried several other alpha hydroxy products before this one (i.e. ROC, etc.) and must say this particular line (ALPHA HYDROX) is far superior to any other I've used.  That it is also apparently considerably less expensive than most is icing on the cake, in my book.

Regarding this product, I find the key is to use it AT LEAST once a day, and always after using a mild cleanser.  At my age I still get acne and, despite my sometimes manic picking, I notice it (and any residual puffiness or redness, and resulting scarring) clears up much, much more quickly than it used to.  Also, my skin breaks out much less than before I used this.  The tone and color of my skin are far improved when compared to prior to using this product.  I've run out of it before and tried to use something else until I was able to locate more locally, and to my dismay the condition of my skin began to deteriorate.

I won't try to insult anyone by saying the Alpha Hydrox line will remove every wrinkle or fix all your skincare woes.  If there is a product out there that does this, I want to know!  But for now, this is by far the best line of products I've used.  I use this item, particularly, with the line of skincare I reviewed previously, as that seems to address reversing the signs of aging better (where this one, for me, just improves the overall condition and appearance of my skin).",1214784000,0,0,0,0,1
1607,4,"05 4, 2011",AN81JUYW2SL24,B000GLRREU,"Waterpik Ultra Flosser

Having used an older model of the Waterpik, I found this new Ultra unit to be significantly quieter and easier to use. The pressure control is now on the base unit and the motor sounds quieter and smoother. With the old model, it sounded like a Sherman tank fired up and I have to close the bathroom door to avoid disturbing anyone else in the house.

The tips are different, so you have to buy replacement tips designed for WP-100 which isn't that well advertised. In my opinion, the manufacturer should have streamlined the tip design so that they used one design/variety and interchange it among models like Oral B does with its electric toothbrushes. The Oral B unit I bought in the mid 1990s uses the same brushes as the new Oral B 5000 I purchased earlier this year.

The spare tips for the Waterpik Ultra are stored in a lid that clips to the reservoir which I think is a faulty idea. I almost broke the lid trying to remove it to fill up the reservoir, and I had no place to put it in the meantime. I almost broke it twice so I just kept it in the box. Waterpik should have kept the tip holder in the base unit to make it convenient for the user.

I normally just use line floss and my hygienist and dentist both agree that my gums look fine, but I use the Waterpik just for extra cleaning.

1720,5,"12 28, 2007",AJ4F2BWA11DBP,B000PKNPES,"This razor is a work of art -- exceptional styling and quality of fit and finish as far as I am concerned. In addition, it shaves quickly and closely with minimal irritation. I also own a new generation CoolSkin 8040X which I use exclusively in the shower with Nivea for Men shaving gel, and it provides an exceptionally close shave with no irritation for my skin/beard type. I received the Arcitec 1050X Christmas Eve, have used several times already both ""dry"" (with a Pre-electric shave lotion) and ""wet"" over the sink with lotion and a few drops of water patted on my face, and it shaves very well either way. I would give the slight edge to the 8040X in terms of closeness and comfort, but I love both, and if you prefer shaving dry, the Arcitec 1050X is an excellent choice. And did I mention that it is a work of art? Beautiful and functional!

Update (1/16/08): This razor really holds its charge well. I am still using the original (initial) charge, and although I don't use this razor to shave everyday, I originally charged it Christmas Eve. Additionally, after seeing several reviews claiming that this razor was only good for shaving everday, and could not handle 2-3 day growth, I recently shaved after allowing my beard to grow for three full days just to test how the razor would handle it. Admittedly, I don't have the heaviest beard growth, but it's not ""light"" either so I can grow a full beard with good coverage. This razor handled my 3-day growth pretty well. Of course, it did take me longer to shave than it normally does if I shave everyday, but I was very pleased with the results. I did not find that the razor bogged down, nor did it pull or snag on any hairs as some claimed it would. The power/rpms were plenty enough to tackle this job with relative ease and I am still very happy with this razor and can highly recommend giving it a try. Remember that if you are really dissatisfied, you can return it to Norelco within 60 days and receive a refund. I returned a previous model that did not work well for me and received my refund check within a month. Good luck, and hope it works for you!",1198800000,0,0,0,0,1

6254,4,"07 15, 2017",A1JDBXPK20HBUW,B013XKHA4M,"After so much hype, I felt compelled to try it myself, especially since I now live in the desert and in the last couple of weeks, there were a couple of d days where it was 107+ at 4% humidity. (Did you even know that was possible?)

- Moisturizing: off the bat, I'll say that if you put this on after your shower on still-wet/moist skin, it absorbs beautifully and really hydrates your skin. It's not just about looking moisturized, but you FEEL moisturized. For a good 1-2 hours post-shower, I am consistently amazed by that feeling of moisture just creeping into my skin, even though it doesn't look like I have any cream left on my body.

- Scent: Unlike others who rave about the scent, I am not a huge fan of the scent. I tend to love my cocoa-butter scented items or things reminiscent of suntan lotion which conjures up images of Hawaiian beaches or sipping a cocktail in Fiji when you're in mid-city traffic. I like how this is heavily scented -- but the scent is more ""warm"" than ""beautiful,"" if that makes any sense. I actually prefer the scent half a day later when you can still whiff some remnants on your skin. That said, it's amazing that when you sweat, the scent comes back to life so I suppose for some who get stinky when they sweat, this is a good thing. Note: I also use this with the body perfume from the same brand...my motto in life is ""Go big or go home,"" what can I say?

- Price: I don't care about the price of the jar itself, but given the amount I use after every shower, which I take every single day, I think one jar will last me about 30-40 days. THEN, this jar is expensive, especially compared to other body lotions and creams. One of my long-time favorites --&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Palmer-s-Cocoa-Butter-Formula-With-Vitamin-E-Lotion-Fragrance-Free-13-5-Ounce-Bottle-Pack-of-4/dp/B001G7R3QK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Palmer's Cocoa Butter Formula With Vitamin E Lotion Fragrance Free , 13.5-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 4)</a>&nbsp;-- is less than $30 for FOUR bottles that are 13.5 ounce each -- and every single bit as moisturizing. Your skin feels like a baby's bottom for the entire day with this stuff. While this is not a scientific claim, I daresay the Palmer's will penetrate more and leave your skin softer overall -- but the BBC instantly absorbs more. Can I justify buying Brazilian Bum Bum Cream when these bottles I have everywhere in my house moisturize just as well, if not more? The four bottles I buy at a time lasts me over a year -- and I have one by the kitchen for my hands, one in my office for random ""OMG I WANT TO MOISTURIZE"" moments, one in the car, and one in my master bath, where the BBC now resides as well. Buying four jars of BBC -- almost $200. No thanks.

Finally -- the sparkles. I am not big on having sparkles on my skin. It's not an excessive amount, but it's definitely there. I like a glow as much as anyone--but I like it oil and moisture-based. Sparkles -- not too crazy about. Then again, maybe it looks fabulous under a disco ball, which I haven't been under in eons. But for daily usage, I'm not big on the sparkles.

For these reasons, I don't think I'll be repurchasing, but it is a very nice body cream. I'll save the rest of the jar for occasions when I am going out and want to smell like an island, but for daily usage, this is not really a worthwhile purchase. But it is a really good body cream.",1500076800,0,0,0,1,0

I was really excited to try these moisturizing booties. Unfortunately, they did not love up to my expectations. First of all, I thought they would moisturize my feet just by wearing them as indicated in the name. They don't. You are supposed to put cream or lotion on your feet before putting them on. This means that the cream/lotion is moisturizing your feet, not the booties. I used to rub lotion on my feet and then wear socks to bed which does the same thing.

I wore these booties to bed and they immediately started annoying me. They have thick seams right at the toes and again at the heel. I couldn't stop rubbing the seams trying to make them more comfortable. Do they help hold in the heat and allow the lotion to really moisturize? Yes. So do socks. I have a pair of really soft, fluffy socks that have the same effect and are more comfortable.

Sadly, I cannot recommend these booties. I would suggest getting a really comfortable pair of socks and using them for the same thing. You can probably find them cheaper and they will work just as well.",1504310400,0,1,0,0,0

After several weeks of using it I can say that the Arcitec is 'better' that the 8140XL and I am therefore pleased with my purchase. While the end result of shaving is basically the same which is not surprising because the Arcitec implements the same 'lift and cut' technology, it appears to be much gentler to my skin, the more flexible shaving heads better follow my face and neck, has a better grip, comes with a more protective storage/charger pod and, of course, is prettier.

But, let's go into some details:

PACKAGING, CONTENTS AND PRESENTATION

The shaver comes to you inside a triple-layered protective/defensive enclosure, hard plastic over cardboard over another clamshell (but easy to open) protective plastic layer. It's not totally bullet-proof but it probably ensures that most units don't suffer any damage while in transit.

Inside I found:

- The shaver itself
- Super-protective (for travel mostly) charging pod
- Cleaning brush
- Charging stand
- Sliding razor head cap
- 100/240V power cord
- User manual and warranty statement (English/Spanish)
- Quick start guide card

Taking the shaver out of its packaging, understanding its operation and making it work was relatively easy.

The manual, covering FOUR separate models is surprisingly well written to the extent that you are not annoyed by having to find the paragraph that applies to your specific model so, know thy model number (it's a 1050). It covers everything, from features, charging options, shaving tips and techniques, cleaning, storage and replacement of the razor head. I've actually read it and I am better off for it.

FEATURES AND OPERATION

Charging
--------
This is one of Arcitec's better features. The manual claims (verified) that it can take a full charge in about one hour and, once charged. I didn't count shaving minutes but, at least with a brand-new battery you won't need to recharge it very often. In 'emergencies', just 3 minutes of charging should give you 3 minutes of shave time.

There is no way to replace the battery inside the shaver but, based on my experience with Architec's precursor, my 2.5 year old 8140XL, this should not be an issue. After all these years the battery still allows me to shave several times before a recharge is needed.

You charge your shaver by either placing it on the charging stand or inside the charging pod. Philips recommends that you do not keep the charging stand continuously connected to the power outlet and I have no problem with that. One one-hour charge session keeps my shaver going for several weeks (I only shave 2-3 times per week).

Shaving
--------
The feature most of us buy a shaver for :)... It's okay, for an electric shaver. I won't say that ""it's as close as a blade"" because it isn't but that's not why I switched from blade shaving to electric some 7 years ago. I am using an electric shaver because shaving with a blade had my skin irritated, especially on my neck. The 8140XL was okay but my neck still felt uncomfortable. The Architec does NOT irritate my neck at all and this is a very good thing.

The above comes with a price. Shaving takes a lot longer. You need to go over the same area several times before all the hairs are 'lifted and cut' but that was a tradeoff I understood and I accepted. Norleco claim that the Arcitec has ""50% more shaving surface"" (compare with the old 8140XL claim of ""up to 50% more shaving surface"") is just marketing hype and always left me ask myself ""50% more than what?"". The reality is that the 3 heads together add up to a decent shaving surface, and the Arcitec's are not larger than the 8140XL's but I would not call them 'humongously large"". And, again, contrary to marketing claims, shaving with the Arcitec or with just about any other electric shaver is not 'fast'.

As I noted before, the Arcitec is very gentle to my skin and this is the main reason, other than good looks, that I prefer it over the older model. Sometimes you need to go several times over the same neck spot because 'lift and cut' is good but not perfect but my experience with the Arcitec is that my skin tolerates it pretty well.

Trimmer
--------
A small trimmer can be pulled out when needed. I am not going to use it that much but I was able to successfully and quickly trim my mustache. It's a useful feature.

Other bells and whistles
-----------------------
When needed, a number of indicators/warnings discretely light up on shaver's body: low battery, charing indicator, needs cleaning indicator, travel lock and shaving head replacement indicator.

MAINTENANCE

I don't like spending a lot of time taking care of my shaving tools and the Arcitec does not need a lot of maintenance. Each of the 3 individual heads can be opened and the hair fragments stored inside are washed away in seconds. Any that don't go can be removed with the providing brush. It's possible to also use liquid soap or degreasing liquid (alcohol) solutions for cleaning but I haven't yet.

The trimmer, if used extensively, could use a couple of drops of mineral oil once or twice per year.

Norelco recommends that the full shaving head assembly is replaced once a year and an 'replace head' indicator should light up on the shaver when that time comes but we are not there yet and I will be making that decision when the time comes.

SUPPORT AND WARRANTY

There is a 45-day money back guarantee. Philips Norelco promise to fully refund your purchase price if you ship them back the product within 45 days of your purchase date. You will be paying for shipping and insurance and they are not responsible for lost items - therefore the need for insurance.

In addition, there is a 2-year limited warranty and warrants against defects and, of course, you lose coverage if you abuse your shaver or you try to fix it your self or through unauthorized repairers.

The 800 numbers you need to call for support or warranty service are printed on several locations on the box and on the manual.

Made in Holland.

DESIGN AND ERGONOMICS

'The looks' is clearly Arcitec's distinguishing feature. I like it but I'm not going to say more because everyone can see the images posted on Amazon's page. As I noted above, all indicators and warnings light up when only when needed and are invisible at any other time. The Arcitec's body shape makes for a very comfortable grip while shaving. I also appreciated the little suction cups at the bottom of the charging stand that add to its stability.

The charging pod, on the other hand, is a little too bulky and it's not easy to close/open and it can't store then shaver while the heads cap is on. I didn't take it on the road yet but, when I do I may appreciate how it protects my shaver but, on the other hand, I don't believe any of my shavers was ever damaged while travelling so I'm not so sure the bulkiness is justified.

Finally, I wish there was some 'case' to carry or store everything. The way the shaver comes, it's possibly to store it inside the pod but then the heads cap, the cleaning brush and the charging cord are 'outside' and they are easy to lose, especially the first two.

MY RATING

I am pleased with my purchase and Arcitec is now my 'regular' shaver. Losing the occasional red spots on my neck was very much worth it. Besides the comfortable shave the Arcitec comes with pretty good support (money back promise, 800 support number), looks good and, based on my prior experience with an earlier Philips Norelco shaver, is likely to last for a long, long time. Some of the marketing claims: quick shave, 50% larger (than what???) are a little bit exaggerated but... that's what our reviews are for.

I hesitated between 4 (I like it) and 5 (I love it) stars. If you expect the Arcitec to fulfill all the marketing claims, you may be slightly disappointed but if you know what to expect from an electric shaver and understand that real-world miracles are very rare, then a 5 star may be the fair rating. I will do a 4 stars at this time for a good quality, well designed electric shaver that appears to be an incremental improvement over previous generations but whose capabilities may be a little over-hyped.

Many years have past and I have shot through quite a few Waterpik models and this is the current one I own. It is a little more evolved than its predecessors, but it still performs in pretty much the same way it always has. You fill the reservoir with water, attach the head to the handle which has a control to turn the water stream on and off, and then turn the device on to produce a spray of water as you move the head around to remove debris from between your teeth and gums. I think of the Waterpik as a power washer for the teeth and gums because it forces out pressurized water to irrigate those areas.
This model has a varying speed control to increase the water pressure to whatever is comfortable and effective for the individual user. It also comes with six different tips. While I use the flossing tip, there are tips for brace wearers, people who have crowns,etc, a tongue cleaner, and a couple of other tips for specific functions.
Other than eliminating the need to floss, the Waterpik has been beneficial to me. My teeth are always clean, I don't have gum disease, plaque, dental decay, etc.

I've never ever had a single bristle fall out of the brush, even when I'm washing it. I also take good care of it and wash it every week with baby shampoo. (Side Note: baby shampoo is significantly less expensive and works better than any ""makeup brush shampoo"")

The bristles are unbelievably soft and give a really even powder coverage and its very easy to vary the fullness of coverage with this brush. The angle is absolutely perfect for applying foundation. I find that this brush works really well with the Bare Minerals loose powder foundation, though I've gotten wonderful results using this brush with pressed powder as well.

This brush is extremely high quality, worth every penny and if you take care of it, it will last you forever.",1398038400,0,0,0,0,1

I was also please that the brushes were in their own case. The case is plastic or vinyl and can roll up. You just tie a bow or not with the plastic strings and you are good to go. The heads of the brushes are very well rounded and the bristle are very thick. The handles are made of some type of plastic coated material and feel very smooth in my hands. The connection between the handle and the brush is black metal so these look very cool.

I have tried brushing my hands with each brush to see if they shed. Thankfully the bristles remain on the brush and not in my hand. The bristles are soft but firm.

One thing I did not like about the set was the strong odor of acetone. I have a very sensitive nose and was overwhelmed by the chemical odor. I decided to leave the brushes in the case outside for a few days so they could air out. After almost a week the acetone odor went away from the vinyl carrying case but the brushes themselves still carry a very strong acetone odor. I am afraid to try these on my face because I am afraid they might be contaminated.

I do work with glitter and do a lot of paper art so I plan on using these beautiful brushes for arts and crafts.

Since the odor did not go away I am afraid I cannot recommend these to others for cosmetic use. They are so beautiful so I hope the company can figure out how to get rid of the odor.

6981,5,"07 5, 2016",A90MDYW8TVBB3,B01EST7TBQ,"This is a very nice hair serum that is targeted at encouraging and speeding up hair growth. The first ingredent, and therefore the  most prevalent ingredient, is a type of silicone. Silicone has become the most popular ingredient for anti-friz and shine serums for hair, not to mention a whole world of cosmetics like oil free moisturizers and foundations. It has a slip to it, which gives silicone the *feeling of being like an oil, but it is by its nature, is totally oil free. And of course, also by its nature, it cannot clog pores or follicles. Infact, the Dae Long Hair Growth Serum formula contains three different types of silicone as its first three ingredients. The active ingredients in the product, or the ingredients that actually enable the product to do its job of encouraging hair growth, are Jojoba Oil, Macadamia Nut Oil, Lupine Protein, and Panax Ginseng. These nourish and stimulate the hair follicles to remain longer in the anagen, or hair growing phase, and to produce healthier, stronger hair from the root. Jojoba oil is a skin compatible oil, meaning that it cannot and does not clog pores or follicles, closely resembles the body's own natural lubrication, and can be absorbed by human hair, skin, and nails. There is also extract of Macadamia Nut Oil, which moisturizes the hair cuticle and shaft and helps to prevent hair breakage and split ends. Hydrolyzed protein from the seeds of the lupine plant are very high in protein and contain 35-45% of all the essential amino acids. Panax ginseng is an extract from the panax ginger root and has nourishing and stimulating qualities that directly feed and nourish the hair follicle. I was fortunate to be able to order this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I have used a great many hair serums and products to stimulate growth of stronger, longer, and healthier hair. One of my favorite things about this Dae Long Hair Growth Serum is that it has a very pleasant fragrance! I also really like that the ingredient list is simple, straightforward, and does not contain weird chemicals or scary preservatives!!! It has a very clean  feel to it, not leaving your hair greasy at the last part that you want to be greasy, the roots. A few drops goes a long way I say five drops will do. While pleasant, It is also important not to over do it!. I have very, very sensitive skin and had no problem at all with this. Time will tell how much it makes the hair grow. I am also taking a good hair, skin & nails vitamin because as a Licensed Esthetician, I know for a fact that you have to feed and nourish INSIDE AS WELL AS OUTSIDE in order to truly grow longer, stronger, and healthier hair!!",1467676800,0,0,0,0,1

After reading about Korean skincare from the Charlotte Cho book about K beauty, I began a skincare routine which religiously included sunscreen. The problem is that American sunscreen is awful stuff, sticky, causes breakouts, shiny, and ruins whatever effect you are trying to create by using multiple skincare products and exfoliate her's and serums each day. Why can't American companies create a product that American women want to wear every day? Even the high-end brands use sunscreen ingredients that sit on top of the skin and cause breakouts.

I tried a few different Asian sunscreens, including<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Biore-KAO-JAPAN-AQUA-RICH-Sarasara-SPF50-PA-50g-Sunscreen/dp/B00SM99KWU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Biore KAO JAPAN AQUA RICH Sarasara SPF50+/PA++++ 50g Sunscreen</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SKIN-AQUA-UV-moisture-Milk-SPF50-PA-40mL-New-2016/dp/B01BM1USIY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SKIN AQUA UV moisture Milk SPF50+ PA+++ 40mL New 2016</a>, and overall really like this one because it spreads on smoothly like a cream rather than a watery liquid, but instead of sitting on the skin like American versions, it almost immediately disappears underneath my fingertips to where I can hardly tell I am wearing it at all. There is the tiniest little iridescent shimmer that gives away the fact that I am wearing some manner of mineral sun protection, but it is actually pretty attractive, like the sort of gentle shimmer that you would get from a brightening cream.

This is the second product I have tried from this brand, and I can't even believe how impressed I am with a brand that I've never heard of before. The fact that these are effective, no-frills, fragrance free products that are incredibly good at doing their job makes me so happy. I don't need fragrance out of my toner or sun protection cream, I just need them to work and work well. And that's what these do.

Ordinary floss will no longer do the job as it cannot be squeezed in between my new teeth. Not very familiar at that time about what a Waterpik is, I went to do my research and find this one to have one of the highest customer satisfaction and at the same time a very affordable price.

It occupies only a small footprint, very easy to setup and very simple to use. The jet has 10 power settings. 1 to 3 is weak, and 8 to 10 might be very strong. I recommend to start by using the number 3 setting and adjust the knob as it suits you.

Included are multiple attachments. Changing between tips is very quick. There is a small button near the base for release and to replace with a new one is just a little push with a click. First, I thought that the brush is the best tool to clean my teeth. But then the brush itself is hindering the water jet particularly when the bristles bend as you brush your teeth. The 2 regular tips are the best for the job. There is one strange looking tool tip for cleaning the tongue, honestly I find no use for that. The orthodontic tip, and the Pik-Pocket tip has a much finer rubber tip for the little crevices around your teeth.

To think about it, with a new dental bridge, I really can not clean my teeth as thorough without a water jet. Not only it cleans the teeth, it also massage the gums.

Very happy with this product. It also makes cleaning teeth more fun. Even my kids are having fun with it. I just wish it includes 3 more regular color coded tips for each member of the family.

Extra:
- This is also great for cleaning small things that has nooks and niches that are impossible to reach.  Good example are those sippy cups that has rubber parts, jewelries, etc.

A word of caution - There is a sticker underneath the base saying not to use it for more than 5 minutes in a 2 hour period. I have my waterpik for almost a month now (averaging 7 minutes of usage including my other 2 kids) and so far so good. But maybe that is the reason why some owners have their unit stopped working in such a short time. It is not a heavy duty appliance.",1250035200,0,0,0,0,1

-------

I recently ordered the Mad Hippie Face Cream, Exfoliating Serum, and Antioxidant Facial Oil, and really like them a lot.  I've only been using them a few days, so I'll be sure to update my review as I use these more, but so far I like the fact that this is a healthier brand, with not many chemicals added to their products.

This Face Cream is not quite hydrating enough for me, but I've found that using the Antioxidant Facial Oil on top helps seal in moisture.

The Mad Hippie website also gives instructions for how to layer their products:

""We recommend gently massaging the vitamin C serum into your skin in the morning after washing and drying thoroughly.  Wait 5 minutes after applying the serum & apply the creams.  Apply the face cream to the entire face, including eye area, then apply the eye cream beside and below the eyesmaking sure to rub both creams in well, particularly around wrinkle prone areas.  Follow this with our extra hydrating antioxidant facial oil.

At night, follow the same steps but replace the vitamin C serum with an exfoliant:  either the exfoliating serum or vitamin A serum.  If just using the creams, wait a couple minutes after washing your face when skin is fully dry to apply. The facial SPF should be used as the final and last step of your morning routine.""",1485043200,0,1,0,0,0

The only thing I wish that this nail polish thinner came with was an eye dropper or a pipette but for the price, that is okay.  I have also used this nail polish thinner to help with the thickening of some older polishes that have gotten a bit globby -- simply add a few drops to the bottle ... wait a couple seconds ... then roll the bottle in between your hands if you are going to use the polish shortly or shake the bottle if you do not plan on using it immediately or right away.  If a few drops does not work ... simply add a few more drops ... wait about 10 seconds ... then proceed to shake away until you hear the small ball bearings inside beat against the wall of the nail polish.  Be careful to only add a couple of drops at at time as you don't want to make the nail polish you are trying to thin out too watery or useless.  The nail polish thinner does have a strong odor, but then again it is a chemical, just be sure to use it in a well ventilated area and be sure to put the cap back on immediately.  I would highly recommend that you do not use this nail polish thinner on a wood table or anything with a lacquer or finish on it - it will eat away at it immediately.  Use this over a sink or put several towels that you do not care about down - just be very careful! Just like you would be very careful with acetone nail polish - use the same caution with the thinner.

This thinner will help you to save money and keep your old polish just like new! It really helped to make old polish or polish that I hadn't completely tightened the lid on smooth and creamy again (almost like new but nothing is exactly like new). After using this thinner in one of my favorite polishes I was able to put up to three semi-thin coats of nail polish on my nails and they have looked really great for nearly a week and it has not begun to chip. The thinner came in a heavy glass bottle and there is plenty to last quite a long time.  Overall I am very pleased with this thinner - I highly recommend it and once I run out, I will definitely purchase it again.

6088,5,"09 16, 2015",A2UNWFVHL0JWBH,B00YB5YZME,"I was expecting to use this only as a callous remover. I've had my fair share of hair removal disappointments over the years from products that don't work. I tried the epilator and was amazed, correction, ASTOUNDED that it actually removed about 98% of my leg hair. It took a bit of time with the first leg but once I got the hang of how to use it I managed to finish leg #2 in less than 10 minutes (rough estimate.) it takes time, and you have to go back and forth to get all the hair. This is essentially a wheel full of tweezers that pulls your hair out by the roots, much like waxing. So you will get the red bumps that will go away in anywhere from a couple of hours to a day. I couldn't believe it didn't pinch my skin at all. I did my legs, my arms (my arms are pretty much hair free from laser treatments but it actually pulled out all the hair plus a lot of the tiny, thin, nearly-invisible blonde hairs), my armpits, my bikini line. I even tried it briefly on my face and I could actually feel it pulling out those baby hairs. I was so excited about how well it worked I didn't save any hair to try the shaver, so my boyfriend allowed me to shave part of his leg. The shaver worked great too! (See photo #2)
And yes, the pedicure tool works also. It's fun to do and you will have powdered skin flying everywhere. Don't sand too far down, it will hurt. Remember, the callouses grow back and sometimes with a vengeance.
This is basically an all in one polishing tool for hair removal and callouses. I'm trying not to sound like an infomercial but I'm just so excited this actually works just how it should.

* UPDATE: I took this on vacation with me, in a house with only two showers and over 10 people I didn't want to take up extra time and since I got this a few weeks before my vacation I skipped shaving completely and used this about every other day. It only took a few minutes, I basically touched up any hairs that had grown out. I was in a bathing suit every day and completely confident. I haven't shaved since I got this, it's wonderful.

Here's my tips on using the epilator:
Let your hair get nice and long, like 1-2 week growth. It needs something to grab onto.
Go up and down and in many directions to get all the hair, it grows in many directions. As long as you can feel it being pulled, it is working.
Hold at a perpendicular angle. (The package will explain how to hold it for each body part, experimentation helps.)
If you miss a hair here or there, use a tweezers instead of madly trying to go over it 10 times.
Turn it off, take the head off and clean it often with the included brush.
You can use it while it is plugged in so you don't have to wait a day (10+ hours of charging time) in between charging cycles.
Aloe Vera gel afterwards to soothe the skin.

Dislike: my red charging light never turned off. Not sure if I just didn't wait long enough but it was plugged in all night and most of the day and light never went off.
It hurts a bit, you will get used to it. After a minute I didn't mind the slight pain at all. Obviously certain parts are more painful than others, like bikini line.

What I've found is that lavender scents can be tricky. Some are intense and other times they can be rather weak or not even smell like lavender at all. The Pre De Provence Maison French Lavender Blossom Linen Water is one that sadly falls into the latter category. I sprayed it on decorative pillows and at first it smelled really good They got the scent correct. But when I picked up the pillow 15 minutes later, it was no longer detectable. I tried it again, this time sniffing it 5 minutes later. Sadly, only the faintest hint of lavender greeted my nostrils. I was disappointed as Im a fan of aromatherapy, but this product just does not pass the muster.

I poured some full strength into my diffuser and it did work then, but that means using a lot of the product. Id rather just add a few drops of essential oil to water. Additionally, Maison has some questionable preservatives (Methylisothiazolinone (MIT) and Methylchloroisothiazolinone (CMIT)) and FD&C Blue 1 and Red 33, rather than just pure scent. It does not come with a spray attachment.

However, I am up to power 8 on this and will be up to a 10 soon) and this intensity works wonderfully on my gums. They actually enjoy their beauty treatment so to speak.

+ Pause Button on the handle  This saves the day for me as when I want to pause, the button is at my fingertips and this helps me not to spray water all around my bathroom.

+ Ease of filling and cleaning - This unit is easy to fill, clean and empty and I like the fact that it is stationery in my bathroom and does not take much counter space.

+ Attachments and what is included  This comes with 6 attachments: Classic Jet Tip, Toothbrush Tip, Tongue Cleaner, Pik Pocket Tip (my favorite attachment as it is really helping my gums), Plaque Seeker Tip, and Orthodontic Tip.
In addition to the attachments, there is a Quick Start sheet to show you how to setup the Waterpik and also there is a small owners manual that has much information on how to use each attachment and how to overall use the Waterpik with pictures and step by steps.

+ Quality and Sound: This unit is almost whisper quiet as the motor is very smooth yet heavy duty at the same time. This is a very superbly made Waterpik!

Highly recommend this for gum health. For me, it has made all the difference in the world on my gums, and allover dental health.",1386806400,0,0,0,0,1

I like the protective rich film it left on my skin and that it is totally unscented.  I have been using Aquaphor since then on regular basis.

I use it for dry and cracked heels and it helps me keep them crack free and pain free. The cream is rich and protective on  my heels but it leave my hands tacky and grease as well.  After spreading it on my heels I need to wash my hands.  It is a small price to pay for having the protective film on my problem areas.

Overall:
1. It is effective
2. It is unscented
3. The effect lasts a fairly long time, I apply it once a day
4. The same cream comes in variety of containers.  I use a big tub at home, and carry a small tube in my purse.

I have been using it for many years. I tried other creams but keep coming back to Eucerin.

The one I previously had gotten hard, I felt like I have to press into my face too much with the old one. When I got this one I immediately loved it 10 times better than my old hard rock sponge. For the price, it beats the $20 beauty blender any day! it's soft on the skin and it blends my foundation in so well. I would recommend this for anyone with dry skin due to the moisture coming from the damp sponge. It does give me an airbrushed finish! However, it does stain easily like any other sponge, so I like to wash it with a baby soap after every use to help avoid stains and bacterial growth. I also like how this one has an angled side! I can use the angled part for under my eye area, and it really helps the process!! You are going to love this makeup sponge!
*UPDATE*
I used this sponge twice now, and the sponge is still really soft!
It didn't shrink into a hard sponge like my old ones, even after it's completely dried! Very impressed!

1563,5,"09 25, 2014",ALC78IZMOVRHN,B000GLRREU,"I bought this based largely on the features and the reviews on Amazon. The hand held WP-450 model has a 2-year warranty, but I've never had the batteries last for two years. Some don't make it to 18 months. The one I bought a year ago now only lasts for about 4 or 5 sessions before the charge dies. I recharge them for over 24 yours when they get week, which is what Waterpik recommends. So I have two so I can use one while the other one charges. Got tired of all this and got this plug in model and I wish I had done this several years ago. Being tethered to the hose is not a problem at all, the hand unit is much lighter and more maneuverable than the battery model, lighter too. I use this on #7 setting on the dial and it is just about the same as my old 450 units with a fresh charge. The highest setting is really powerful! Control easy to use, uses the same tips as my old units. I floss first, lightly brush with a tooth brush, then use a Sonicare. After this routing my hygienist still found food under my gums during a routing cleaning! That is when I added the Waterpik to my routine and they never found food after that again. Amazing to see what flossing and brushing with a Sonicare leaves behind. I am 67 and my gums have receded, so I need the extra flushing power of a water flosser. Dental floss does not get down between the gum and base of the tooth. I recommend this for anyone who is either starting out with your first water flosser or using a rechargable unit that you don't want to replace every 18 months because the battery is failing. Extra tips store in the lid to the tank. Tank easy to remove for cleaning. Can even be washed in the dishwasher if you remove the rubber valve/plug unit. I love the design, tube coils up and stores in the side of the unit with the handle slipping in a holder, all tucked out of the way.

It measures 4 inches wide and is 2.5 inches high and over an inch thick.  It is a light cocoa color with engravings on both sides of the bar.  The soap comes wrapped in plastic, but the aroma is unmistakably Patchouli.

To me, the scent the Patchouli reminds me of ""Dead Heads,"" or followers of the band Grateful Dead.  They made Patchouli oil main stream.  But Patchouli is also good to fight itchy skin, and smells wonderful. It has an unmistakable musky floral aroma.

This soap is also Shea Butter enriched, which means luxurious softness.  Nothing I've found blends into my skin like Shea Butter, and I have been religiously using Pre de Provence lotions with Shea Butter for a while now.  Their products are high quality and make me feel pampered.  The scents are delicious - I am feeding my soul with these wonderful fragrances.

While women will love this Patchouli Shea Butter Enriched soap, it will also be great for a man.  Patchouli is quite masculine.

This bar of soap is great for putting in your bathtub.  Or keep a bar at the sink to lather up and smell good between showers.  It makes a great gift - an addition to a gift basket for men or women.

The 1/4"" Jaws feature a 3/16"" Bevel on the Tips which allows me to get under and between areas which are usually difficult to trim.
The Tips of the Blades are Super Sharp and they sit tightly together when closed, with no gaps or jagged areas.
I appreciate that the Jaw can be opened to a full 5/8"" and the tension of the Lever Spring is just enough to put a little muscle behind the Jaw, allowing it to cut more efficiently.
There is an easy to manipulate Locking Safety Latch which holds the two handles together and keeps the Jaw with blades locked together in the closed position.
KlipPro Personal Care Products includes a Silicone Safety Cap which fits over the Jaw to protect the blades and prevent injury while being stored.

I think it's better simply due to the fact it comes in tablet for as opposed to a capsule form.  This aids in easy swallowing as the tablet doesn't get stuck on your tongue like a gelcap does.

5644,4,"03 20, 2015",A1BRCVMQ7C9CGJ,B00S8JQKEA,"This is easy to apply and use. It takes a little longer because of the two products you need to apply and the extra steps to achieve the look you want, though. The first step is some sort of mascara gel. You have to use that step before you can use the second step. You have to apply the second tube, which are the fibers immediately after using the first tube. You then can do all the steps over again to get more fibers to stick to your eyelashes. The fiber tube is dry so you must apply it quickly after applying the mascara gel. Do one eye completely before doing the second eye. I wish this came with a dry eyelash brush for when I am completely done with all the steps. My eyelashes started to clump but if you have, an eyelash brush than you can fix that problem and your eyelashes will look beautiful.

I have never tried any sort of fiber mascara before so I was thrilled to buy this at a discount. It comes with good instructions, which I really appreciated. The instructions say you can apply your regular mascara first, if you want too, so I tried that. I liked the results better this way. I also could then see the added length from the fibers. The fibers do seem to fall down onto your face as the day goes on though. You will get little flexes but they are so tiny it really wasn't a big deal to me. I wish the fibers were not so dry though but I guess that is why it comes with a gel that you're supposed to apply first.  I love the packaging and the box this comes in. It's so cute and it feels like the box has a magnet closure, which is really nice.

I chose Body Wonders Apricot Oil because its hexane free, not tested on animals and its rich in vitamin A and E. I also saw all of the amazing benefits of apricot seed oil and that you can use it in your hair, on your face as a serum, as a massage oil, for itchiness and inflammation, etc. I was planning on making massage oil mixed with different essential oils, but ended up using it before I got around to making my mix. Well by using it, I meant I made my boyfriend use it to give me a massage!! (ha ha!) I love that it absorbs some, but not very quickly because with massage, you need to have a surface that makes it easy to move and manipulate the muscles. It does have a light texture though so its not a very thick residue. The massage was great and the oil definitely helped a lot!
After my massage I was excited to try other things. I used a small amount on my hair and scalp and added a couple drops of peppermint essential oil since I heard that it was good for your scalp as well. I also made a mini massage oil with the oil and added lavender essential oil, which I used for a hand massage. I like my skin moisturized so I found myself using it as a lotion on my hands and legs too. There are really a lot of options you can try with this oil.

I also love that its such a big bottle (16 fl oz.) so it will last a long time! Its a great quality and versatile product at a good price so I was glad I was able to try it at a discount in return for my honest and unbiased opinion. I cant wait to Body Wonders other oils.",1444176000,0,0,0,0,1

I decided to do one side of my hair to show the difference in the attached photo.  I do have thick hair so I have to divide my hair in order to get to the hair underneath.  I was impressed how the brush glided through my hair smoothly without tangling or hesitation.  It left my hair silky and shiny - that is the ceramic icons at work!

The only features I did not care for is being unable to change the temperature readout from Celsius to Fahrenheit and not being able to lock the temperature setting.  My fingers repeatedly touched the buttons and would lower and sometimes turn off the brush.

The brush does get extremely hot so I strongly recommend using a heat styling glove.  I would probably use the brush for touch-ups, but will continue to use my flat iron to completely straighten my hair since it is just a time consuming if not, maybe even takes up more time since you have to go over your hair repetitively to achieve a pin straight result.

But I have lately been trying some exquisite brands of beauty products that have shown to be enriching & full of life in regards to care. Overall, some of them haven't worked very well, but other products have surprised me. There has been a European brand that I have recently been trying products from called Pre' de Provence. Honestly, I have been very surprised about how enriching their skin care bath care products have been. Lately, I have recently tried some of their body lotion with a lavender scent & honestly it felt very luxurious. The lotion brings in a better sense of moisture & quality in my chapped skin all over my body. While it does cost more than what you would get in other places, it still does a better job for the money. I would suggest that you do give this lotion a try. It might be small, but carries a lot of beauty in product.

8762,4,"03 11, 2016",A152C9DCMDC21C,B01A50XEP2,"I was interested in trying this night cream because it claims to be especially formulated for oily to normal skin.

PACKAGING:

The night cream comes in a squeezable tube. I am not a big fan of this type of packaging because as you continue to use it, it becomes harder to get the product out and it can be wasteful. However, this type of packaging is great for traveling. Also, while I am not super impressed with the packaging, it does a nice job at keeping the product fresh.

FIRST IMPRESSION: 

It has a light to medium consistency. It has a yellowish color but it does not stain your skin. It has a light scent and it is creamy. It is easy to distribute and apply. It does not irritate or cause redness. While you apply it it has a almost glossy finish and the skin feels soft but as it dries the skin looks matte and it feels smooth. There is no visible residue.

PERFORMANCE:

After I used it the first time I thought, ""Actually this is nice, I think I will really like it"", but after using it a few more times, I have changed my opinion. It has great benefits and it excels in some areas but in others I am not very impress with it.

I am impress with the quality and its natural ingredients. It feels really nice when you put it on and the scent is not overbearing which is great. It has no parabens or dangerous chemicals. It is cruelty-free. It does not irritate my skin and it does not cause breakouts. It dries very fast which is great for those long days when I can wait to long to go to bed. It does not have a sticky or greasy finish.

I have been using two different serums and they do not seen to get alone with this cream. So I change it to another and the same problem occur. After my serum is absorb into my skin, I apply this cream but it does not go on smoothly. It looks like brush strokes and it is very patchy. At first, I thought that I was applying to much but the results were the same with less product. This is not a big deal since it will dry either way. But it bother me for some reason.

I enjoy how soft and supple my skin feels as soon as I apply it but then it losses that quality and becomes very matte and it is not longer super soft. My face feels a bit stiff. I would not mind much since it might be helping my skin stay firm. Buw when I wake up in the morning my skin does not feel very moisturize which I do not like. Every time I use it, I want to add a sleeping pack on top for moisture.

However, I have to mentioned that while my skin does not feel supple and hydrated in the morning, it is not greasy or oily either. I am not saying the it will remove all of your sebum/oil but it just makes your skin look matte. I give it points for that but honestly, I rather give my skin hydration at night and I do not care much about looking oily.

TIP: Order Pros-Aide aka Spirit Gum from Amazon to keep the tapes in place and on tight.  Step #1:  First wipe the facial/neck area with a cotton pad soaked with alcohol to remove any dirt or makeup.  Let dry.  Step #2: Peel off one tape at a time and brush on a small amount of the Spirit Gum then pressing onto the side of your face or neck, holding for 20 seconds while it adheres.  For the face, place each rubber band behind your ear and out of the way while you repeat the other side.  Step #3: Hook up in the back of your head.  Step #4: Lightly brush on tinted face powder over the tapes to help conceal them.  Step #5:  Before retiring, remove the bands with the tapes still attached, glue side up,  and store somewhere DRY, i.e, on your dresser, vanity, etc., where there is no chance of them getting wet.  Now, the next time when you're ready to RE-USE the tapes, repeat all the Steps with the SAME tapes.  This idea saves you money and you get a lot more wear.",1434585600,0,0,0,0,1

I'm not too upset by the death of my Bodygroom - while I had hoped it would last longer it wasn't very expensive to start with so I'll order another one.  Why?  Because it gets the job done.

Yes, the guard clogs with hair quickly.  That's why I use it in the shower...makes cleanup much easier!  If I trim too quickly the guard comes off but fortunately I haven't shaved a bare swath across my chest...yet.

As for the more sensitive areas, well, it works well there too without pain - if you're careful.  It's easy to get the wrong angle and have the trimmer blade (that cuts with the guard) contact skin.  Work slowly to ensure only the center touches skin.

It's not perfect but it works great for taming unruly chest hair, and if you prefer a smoother look elsewhere, well, it can take care of that too.",1294272000,0,0,0,1,0
5328,5,"02 3, 2015",A2B7PG6P30GPZT,B00K2CRAYK,"So I tried out a similar eye mask that was only for under the eyes. This one goes around the whole outer part of your eye. Let me say that these collagen eye mask work fantastic!! After 30 to 60 minutes of use. Your dark circles and puffiness are gone. Its almost like having a mini facelift!  i would use them a few times a week.

Collagen  protein is present in the connective tissue of the human body. It is produced naturally in the body and is responsible for the rejuvenation of not only the skin but also joints and nails.

The production of collagen is slowed around the age of 25. After that with each passing year the body produces less and less collagen.

Though it is not rapid but gradually the signs start showing on your face in the form of dullness, fine lines, age spots, bags and dark circles under eyes and later on sadly wrinkles.

The benefits of collagen for skin are that you will slow down all the conditions mentioned above and hence reduce the aging process.

Solution For All Your Skin Care Problems

Even if you are not using the collagen that is specifically designed to eliminate the dark circles and bags under your eyes. This will rejuvenate your skin making it radiant, youthful, and flawless.

Hyaluronic serum can offer a wide range of benefits. It is definitely effective in helping to produce healthier, younger looking skin. A low molecular weight hyaluronic serum can penetrate deep into your skin, hydrating cells, restoring collagen and elastin function, and even destroying the free radicals that form from sun, chemical, and pollutant exposure. Hyaluronic serum is actually an excellent antioxidant, and when your serum is capable of reaching the deepest layers of your skin, it can be incredibly effective at reversing damage to your cells.

As I'm not much of a pill taker, I switched to liquid, but then progressed to magnesium oil for better transdermal absorption.  I like this form, but find it leaves my skin feeling itchy.

Applying to the soles of my feet works best, but I've used it elsewhere and find little to no irritation.

The salt used in Seven Minerals is sourced from the Great Salt Lake.  I was concerned about possible mercury contamination and contacted the company about their purification process.  What a surprise to get an immediate response with detailed information, including testing analysis from their supplier.  This product is free of organic volatile impurities and heavy metal detection is insignificant (less than 0.001%).

This is the first time I've used magnesium oil with aloe vera, and I'm impressed.  It's a little pricey, but the 12 oz. bottle lasts a long time and I love the convenience of a spray bottle that works well.",1422576000,0,0,0,0,1

After throwing out all those products, I am so glad that Zia's money-back guarantee made me decide to give one last product a try as it's made exfoliating my body a wonderfully nurturing experience I look forward to instead of a dreaded chore neglected despite my body's need for it.  As an added bonus, it's one of the few that uses both sugar and salt as each brings their own benefits, leading to better results than from just a salt or just a sugar based product.  Most importantly it's a nice neutral smell instead of the mostly over the top scents that seem so popular for these products.  Best of all of course is the fact that it leaves your skin so wonderfully smooth and moisturised, especially if you don't towel yourself off and instead air dry to let the oils sink in.

7403,5,"08 11, 2017",A2EWF2OWK60DJW,B005DMBC0C,"After years and years and YEARS of searching for some sort of SPF product that would keep my lips from burning, I can't believe it's this Lip Ink shine layer that has finally done it for me.  I'd tried every highly touted product; bull frog, white-ish zinc products, lipsticks with high SPF, and inevitably if I was out in the sun all day, my lips would be horribly swollen the next day - the problem (as I assessed it) was that with my mouth slightly open while breathing hard (running around playing frisbee or kadima on the beach), my lower lip caught the sunshine - the angle from above being such that the direct sun would hit on my lower lip right where the dry outer lip transitioned to the wet 'inner' lip where lipstick and lip balm didn't seem to stay on, and I was simply at a loss to find *anything* that would protect that area without immediately wearing off by lip licking or whatever - I mean you know what I'm talking about, we have lips - lipstick doesn't stay on the 'inside' of your mouth.... so I was seriously fearing I'd develop lip cancer and live the last few decades of my life with my lips removed and horribly disfigured (I have a morbid imagination).

So then last year I discovered the lip ink with this lip shine moisturizing top coat (which I love for all day wear) but I was VERY FEARFUL of really putting it to the test and wearing it without any additional sunscreen on my lips - but I was cautiously thrilled when the first attempt of a half day at the beach did not result in any swollen lips.  Then I tried it again and again, on longer days until I was out there from 9am to 6pm in the full on summer sun (reapplying the shine layer whenever I noticed my lips getting dry) and miraculously - this is the first and only product to truly protect my lips, without any hint of burning, tenderness, or swelling the next day.

I find myself wondering how it really works, because it's a 'light' smooth innocuous non-viscous layer, it's not like it's glued on my lips or even waterproof - and yet it really works.  I think if it's possible, maybe there is some protective element that absorbs into the skin so it works even if it wears off temporarily?

I would like to add for anyone with burn-sensitive lips that is going to use this as lip sunscreen, the lip ink COLOR layer does not have any SPF and I had not realized that and wore that by itself without reapplying the clear shine layer and my lips DID BURN.  But after looking up the product info, that is what they do specify - no SPF on the color layer, all the SPF is in the shine layer.  But it is PLENTY effective as long as you keep reapplying.  And if that wasn't great enough - you can look fabulous on the beach with your shiny fresh lip-ink color lips!  I like having an 'excuse' (the SPF) to wear makeup out at the beach :)",1502409600,0,0,0,0,1

There are two brush heads included, one that spins and one that goes back-and-forth.  (I like the spinning head the best.)  This is my first experience with an electric toothbrush at home.

The charging base is nice, with no wall wart or metal contacts.  At least when new, the battery will last for a full week of twice- or thrice-daily brushings.  There is a red LED that flashes when power is low and a green LED that flashes while charging.

The brush tips change easily but don't come off under use and they have colored rings to identify brush heads for multiple users.  The handle is just the right size and has soft-touch plastic so it is comfortable and easy to grip.  It really is waterproof because I have been using it in the shower with no problems.  I would hesitate to actually immerse the bottom of the handle.

No complaints at all with this toothbrush except that the heads are rather costly compared to a manual toothbrush.  I do think it's worth the expense, though, for the ease in brushing.  This would be especially helpful for anyone with arthritis in the hands.

It is necessary to use a soft touch with these brushes;  it is not pressure but the movement of the bristles that disturbs the plaque.  Be especially careful if you have gum recession or crowns.  The brush will stop if you apply too much pressure, which is useful.",1385596800,0,0,0,0,1

I accepted in hopes that I would finally own a quality pair of easy to use Eyebrow Tweezers.
So Happy To Report That KlipPro Did Not Disappoint!
The Ergonomic Design of these Eyebrow Tweezers make them so Easy to Grip! I have arthritis in my fingers and I am so pleased to finally own a pair of tweezers that allow me to hold them Comfortably for the duration of time it takes to pluck my unruly brows.
I love that these KlipPro Tweezers are Longer and Wider than other tweezers I own. The  3.8"" x 0.6"" x 0.5"" dimensions make them Easier to Manipulate without the frustration of slipping or twisting that I have experienced with shorter, thinner tweezers.
The Slanted Tips of these tweezers allows for a Firm Hold of my eyebrow hairs, and I appreciate that they Sit Flush along the entire tip.
So nice to own a pair of tweezers that allows me to utilize the Entire Tip and not just the portions where the blades happen to come together.
I also love that these KlipPro Tweezers are made of Rust and Tarnish Resistant Stainless Steel. I expect them to last a very long time.

I like the idea of less mess but the pump takes a little more push power than you would expect at first. Not a big deal.

This toothpaste is great for the enamel as the toothpaste can make the weak areas strong and also it works on plaque buildup.

The label comes off so you can see all of the information wrapped around the tube and without the label, you can see how much is left. I also like the fact that it has a plastic cap on top that you can keep on it when not in use. There is a small area where the toothpaste comes out and that protect the area if you accidentally drop it on the floor.

I have shoulder length, thin, flat, professionally colored/highlighted hair.  I was expecting a very light product because of the whip name, but it wasn't. It was thicker than a mousse, but lighter than a cream. It does have a nice texture and scent. They recommend using a walnut size amount. That may work for thicker hair. I found the more I used, the more I felt like I had a heavy hair product on my roots, even when my hair was dry. This product did not add any extra volume to my flat hair than a normal blow dry would. It does control fly away hair. Even on a second day blow out, it still kept the fly aways under control.

I would recommend this product depending on your hair texture and needs. Right now it's winter where I live and the temperature has been low twenties. Which means lots of static and fly away hair. So I have been using this product, just in smaller amounts than recommended.",1395014400,0,0,0,1,0

This product is best at helping preserve your skin from more damage and smooths out  wrinkles.  This is no miracle in a jar but it does what it is suppose to do.  There are many creams out there with the same ingredients that cost way more than this.  I think tis is a good buy and will continue to use it.

She watches alot of beauty videos and her face always looks flawless.
I saw these new design brushes and thought these would be something good for her to try with her skills.
The design and feel of these brushes are completely different than traditional Make up brushes in terms of the handle design and also the brush material and feel.
The handles are a plastic material and has a toothbrush like shape to them. There are 10 different brushes.
The actual brush part is very dense and compact synthetic fibers and the tops of the brushes actually feel like velvet. They are very soft and the fibers do not separate like a traditional brush. These types of brushes are supposed to be good for blending both creams and powders, loose or compact.
My Daughter has been using those little sponge like applicators and tried these brushes but said she preferred the sponges.
This may be a matter of opinion in the user and what look they want to achieve and so forth. She's very picky on her cosmetics. She thought that the sponges do a better job of rubbing the product into her skin that these brushes did. She felt like it moved the product around more than actually blending it in to her skin. She was using a liquid concealer, liquid foundation and loose minerals. So she did try them on a few different products and felt she got the same results.
So for her she like the look and feel of the brushes but for application purposes was not a huge fan.
My Oldest Daughter was eyeing the brushes and wanted to try them, so she is going to wash them and let her have a try at them.
High quality in materials and workmanship.

Pros:

- jet current is very strong on 10. If you're getting a weak jet, you are probably using the wrong nozzle. (That's what I did to break it! See notes at bottom)

- angled jet nozzle sprays water behind and between teeth, where a brush can't reach

- water jet is gentler on gums and teeth than brushing, massages gums

- leaves my gums tingly w/ the clean feeling of having been freshly sandblasted

- very fast warranty response and parts replacement

Cons:

- I really hate the flip top storage compartment. It gets in the way when trying to lift off the lid to fill water. Also, there are 4 slots, but 5 nozzles (not counting the one inserted into the handle), so one of them has to sit loose inside the lid.

- flimsy feeling handle and coiled hose

- no real difference between 6 on the dial and 10 while using turquoise nozzle

- very noisy and creates a lot of rumbling during use

- takes up quite a bit of space on my limited sink countertop

All in all, a good product for the price and a good investment in your dental health. When I first got this unit, I was using it wrong. I chose the narrowest head (yellow) and cranked it up to 10, thinking I'd get the maximum blast force for my money.

The jet felt very weak, but I continued to use this configuration without trying the other nozzles, until 2 months later when the spring fell out of the operating handle and broke apart. I found out from customer service that yellow should be set to 3 maximum. They promptly sent me a new hose/handle (arrived in 3 days from CT). Replacement was very easy and took 5 mins.

Even in those 2 months of sporadic use before breaking, I noticed an improvement in my dental health. In conjunction with the Waterpik, I have also been using an Oral B electric toothbrush and floss. My gums stopped bleeding after 2 wks of initial use, a problem I've had for years with manual brushing.

So now, I use the turquoise head on 10. Very powerful and leaves me feeling fresh, although still noisy with the rattling.",1244160000,0,0,0,1,0

I did not have any of the burning experienced by others, but this stuff is just weird.  After about 20-30 seconds, you feel blobs of gunk floating around in your mouth.  I don't know if it's itself coagulating or dissolved parts of my mouth or both, but a mouthful of white, stringy blobs is gross.  It takes quite a bit of rinsing to get all of the yuck out of my mouth.  Performance-wise, it does seem to be effective, and hence the 3 stars.

I have tried other mouthwashes in the past that also dissolved my mouth, but with those, there was a slough-off later after using it -- not while using it.  The Crest Clinical is somewhat of a turn-off in a nauseating sort of way because of this.  Definitely try a very small bottle first as I was tempted to throw it out many times.  I will stay with the Crest 3D White for now.

I have also recently tried the Colgate Optic White mouthwash, and while I love the Optic White toothpaste, the mouthwash (which performs well) borderlines on burning and tastes like bleach.",1351036800,0,0,1,0,0

In this version, sent to me for evaluation and review, the pure ingredient comes in the form of an almost odourless, fairly liquid, clear gel that is easily absorbed by my skin.  But, more importantly, this serum instantly and visibly tightens my skin (you could call it a face lift effect) and causes the cream or lotion that I apply on top to be swallowed up in a way I have seldom seen.  I know from experience how much moisturizer my face can drink up with, or without, a serum.  This product makes my skin twice as thirsty!  I could not believe it the first time, I thought my face must be particularly dry.  But now I see that it is a feature of this product, as I regularly need to follow up with twice as much as normal of my chosen skin care.  The result is a visibly more nourished face and neck and a noticeable smoothing of the lines and wrinkles around eyes and mouth.

The bottle is dark and stylish, elongated to accommodate a sizeable glass dropper.  While this allows precise dispensing, it is difficult to get the last of the gel out of the bottle.  Also the dark, opaque finish makes it impossible to see how much product is left, so I have no idea when I need to buy the next bottle.  Anyway, that is my only minor criticism of an otherwise excellent product.  The bottle contains 30 ml (or a little over 1 ounce) of serum, which is pretty standard for this class of skin care.  At the current price of just under $45, this compares very favourably with similar products which are not nearly as effective.

With age, my skin has become fragile and ultra sensitive to harsh ingredients.  This serum has not caused any irritation, redness or other adverse reaction, even applied to the tender skin around the eyes.  In fact, my face feels refreshed and toned after I apply it, and more than ready to absorb the product that follows.  I think it bears repeating that a serum is a carrier, it facilitates absorption of whatever you choose to put on your skin afterwards.  A seriously proactive serum like this one should not be applied by itself.  Depending on your age and the state of your skin, you can choose the potency of the moisturizer that follows.  In my case, I often layer two products and I find that this serum easily allows both to sink in where they have a chance to do some good.

I bought this brush set with my own money, at a discount, in exchange for a candid review, and given the amount of makeup and makeup brushes I own, I think I'm a pretty good candidate to review this item!

What I Liked:
---It's every bit as pretty as the product image.  The brushes are an aqua-greenish-blue tone with matte black branded handles.
---The brushes are cut fairly well.  So where there are supposed to be rounded angles, the curves are fairly smooth (except for several of the skinny brushes.)
---On the wider brushes, the density is quite good.  If the brush is too sparse, it takes too long to cover your face with foundation.
---The brush hairs are pretty soft.  Not quite as soft as the Urban Decay Good Karma brush, but certainly softer than Bare Minerals brushes, if that helps.

What Could Be Better:
---The handles are longer than they need to be, especially on the skinny brushes.  I don't know why they had to make those so long.
---The handles are branded, but not imprinted with the brush function.  So you just have to figure out what each brush is for.  I've been wearing makeup for 2 decades, and I'd be lying if I said I automatically knew what each brush was for.  I particularly had trouble figuring out what the skinny angled brush and skinny flat top brush are for.  The flat top is a complete mystery to me.
---Given the size of that brush roll, they might as well have included a simple zip pocket.  There's plenty of space for it.

What Doesn't Bother Me At All:
---There's already been some shedding, although that's to be expected.
---The brush roll *is* synthetic, and when you first open it up, it smells like vinyl/pleather/polyurethane, etc.  But it *does* dissipate.  It doesn't stay like that forever.  Maybe some people are just more sensitive, I guess?

I think this is a great set for the price, and part of the charm is the color.  Yes, that may be a stupid reason, but I think there are plenty of people who'll agree anyway.  Will this brush set replace my ridiculously expensive Marc Jacobs foundation brushes?  No.  But that's why you splurge on one top quality foundation brush that lasts forever, and then save some cash when it comes to your blush and highlighter brushes, where you can afford to be a little imprecise.  The skinnier brushes are slightly less useful to me, but on the other hand there have been plenty of times when I just need a clean eyeshadow blending brush, and have a couple of spares on hand means I don't have to stop everything to cleanse my shadow brush on the spot.  I don't have any trouble recommending this set to anyone--it's cute and functional.  So what if its not heirloom quality?",1455667200,0,0,0,0,1

Although this is my first encounter with this brand, I must say this is a great face cream under makeup and I am glad that I found exactly what I have been looking for. The first thing I like about this product is that it is fast absorbing without any annoying residues. My makeup goes on smoothly and evenly. I also like and respect at all ingredients and directions easily accessible on the side of the container. I really enjoy the tube design container which I can easily squeeze the exact amount of the cream I want and I find it extremely convenient and portable which can be slipped into my purse wherever I go.

It feels smooth and luxurious when I spread it over my face and neck. I have not experienced any irritation or negative reaction to this cream. Nevertheless, it is gentle enough to apply even under my eyes without any burning or itching sensation which has happened with a lot of beauty products I tried over the years. It also has no scent that I can detect which makes this moisturizer perfect for my skin type and my skin soaks right into this product rather quickly. I instantly love the way it makes my face feel soft and supple on first use and the results over the past week alone have continued to smooth my skin significantly. It sits well under my sunscreen or foundation. My makeup does not shift or move after I put it on.

This moisturizer is pretty amazing that it provides moisture without causing any breakouts. This is by far the best daytime moisturizer that I have ever used not only it provides the basic UV protection and a nice matte finish under my foundation, and it also enhances my makeup giving me a flawless and radiant appearance. This product is such a great find that I will always keep one in my purse or carry-on bag. Highly recommend!

Pre De Provence Maison French Lavender bath salts come in a plastic 19 ounce container with a screw lid.  There is no protective seal on the product bottle.

Lavender salts are fragrant salts that you pour into your bathwater when the bathtub is filling with water.  They relax you, and help to ease tensions with their floral fragrances.

These bath salts are quite potent.  A little bit goes a long way, as the scent is pungent.

Pamper yourself after a long day by adding these to your bath.  Relax and inhale the beautiful fragrance of lavender.

These also work well when incorporated into sachets.

The only reason I subtracted a star is because I had to give my tub an extra rinse after taking my Lavender incensed bath with these salts.",1504051200,0,0,0,1,0

I put onto my eyes and there was no sticky feel, which I do not like sticky on my face or body for that ,matter,  anywhere!

One plus that I love with this Pure Body Naturals Eye Cream Eye Gel is that it didn't burn my eyes. I guess I have sensitive eyes and lots of moisturizers and creams burn my eyes so bad, and this one doesn't.

I haven't been using this cream long enough to say anything about long term results, but let me tell you, when I woke up the next morning my under eye wrinkle creases were barely visible!

I grew up on Orange Juice with breakfast, because it's high in Vitamin C.  So I just associate Vitamin C with healthy mornings.  These days, I not only drink it, but I also use it on my face.  The way orange juice is sunshine in a glass, New York Biology Vitamin C Serum is sunshine in a bottle - it has brightening properties that make skin look clear and radiant... and my face can use all the help it can get to look radiant in the morning.  Coffee helps, too...

Very lightly scented with lavender and orange peel oil, this semi-milky/light yellow serum is a really nice consistency.  It doesn't run away like some watery serums, but it's not too thick to spread evenly and easily.  It also absorbs very quickly, with no residue - and doesn't interfere with my makeup application, either.  I also like the amber bottle that helps protect the serum from light.  I'd prefer a pump to a dropper, but it does the job.

Vitamin C is notoriously unstable and quick to degrade, but New York Biology claims that their serum is shelf-stable for a year because of their 3 forms of Ascorbic Acid - plus, they only create small batches that sell out about every 30 days.  Using this twice a day, it won't last a year anyway, but it's good to know that it will stay fresh the whole time I'm using it.  If you're ever unhappy with the serum, however, they have an unconditional money-back guarantee.  With natural ingredients, and a paraben-, sulfate- and cruelty-free formula, plus a light, pleasant scent - what's not to like?  Plus, my oily, aging skin loves it.  The formula doesn't make my skin greasy or break me out, nor is it irritating.  My skin is soft and bright. And though I can't see Free Radicals with my eyes, my skin looks less damaged, and more youthful.

What I wasn't expecting was that my hair would feel so wonderfully soft and full after the first wash! It lathered beautifully with just a dab of shampoo, rinsed easily and without being fly-away or unmanageable at all, my hair is really so soft. I'm kinda stunned. (As I always do, I rubbed actual coconut oil on my hands and then ran my hands through my hair before blow-drying. But I've always done that. My hair has never felt this good so it isn't because of the light coconut oil finish.)

This cream doesn't really smell anything like coconut oil, but more like a clean baby -- I don't know why.

If you haven't read that post you can read it on my blog, GlamRiver.
This gel cleanser 100% natural and is formulated for normal to oily skin and is free from Parabens and other chemicals, artificial fragrances, colors and preservatives.  It's a foaming cleanser that contains active Manuka Honey which is known to help stimulates cell renewal and helps soothe inflamed skin, heal blemishes, balance skin's pH levels and slough away dead skin cells.  It also contains my beloved Manuka Oil which has similar benefits so it's now wonder this worked so well on my oily, problematic skin.
I you are suffering from any kind of skin issues or irritation then I would recommend you get your hands on this Manuka Honey & Manuka Oil Cleanser by Natural Beauty Limited and the Manuka Oil as well.  It's a great natural alternative to using a bunch of chemicals on your skin that can do more harm than good.

Before I owned four hair straighteners from four different brands, and I wasn't happy with any one of them. Those straighteners I had really damaged my hair to the point I never ever wanted to use a hair straightener again in my life! I suffered from split ends, damaged cuticles, lack of shine on my hair. That's why I stopped using heat on my hair. Not even a hair dryer!
I mean I literally dumped everything that caused my hair to damage, and switched all of my shampoos, conditioners to a more natural less harmful alternatives. However, no matter what I do, it didn't help with my ""dead hair"", so I recently had my hair cut short. And because of that, my hair has become a lot healthier!  Although, something else became a problem since I cut my hair short, whenever it touches my shoulder, my hair flips and curls! I didn't like the way it looked, so I had to consider buying a straighter again... So I went online, and I found this Opshorie Hair Straightener Brush. I was hooked from the moment I saw this, and this has quickly become my new absolute favorite straightener!
It's a brush and a straightener! How amazing is this?! I never ever had such a great experience with these tools. But I'm so glad I gave this guy a try, because my hair isn't damaged at all even after using it twenty times! I love this thing! You won't regret buying this set!

1715,5,"12 11, 2007",A13700AF4X40YG,B000PKKAGO,"I was skeptical about this shaver because of my past experience with electric razors. I want a very close shave and get it using shaving cream and Mach 3 blades (along with the cuts and chafing). In the past, I just couldn't get it with electric razors.  With the first shave, I wasn't real happy (not bad, but not great). My wife suggested reading the manual. There I discovered that I was using the shaver like I did a blade... pushing down hard against my skin.  The correct way is pulling the skin tight and going lightly over the skin.  This made all the difference. A really smooth shave was the result with no pain or chafing. Also the razor heads ran cooler (a little warm but not hot). I'm a convert... haven't gone back to blades!

Philips/Norelco claims that a charge will get you about a weeks worth of shaves (65 minutes of runtime per charge).  That may be true for most people but I really want a close shave and take about 10 minutes to shave.  That gives me 6 shaves on a charge plus a few extra minutes for cleaning). The top of the line model actually has a display that tells you how many minutes of shaving time is left on the battery. At first I thought this was a gimmick but as you charge it the display counts up.  This allows you to charge the  razor just enough for a shave if you find your battery completely run down.

As for cleaning, these are 3 ways to do it. The slow (and least effective) way is to open the heads and use the included brush. The heads just pop open by squezing their sides. The 2nd way is to rinse the open heads off under hot running water with the razor running.  This is fast, very effective and my favorite method. A third method is to fill your sink with hot water and submerse just the heads with the razor running for a few minutes. With the last 2 methods, you need to leave the heads open so that the razor can dry.  Any way you do it, cleaning is quick and not a pain to do.

The shaver comes with a nice stand (that also can charge the razor). It features suction cups on the bottom so that it won't slide if the vanity top gets wet (a nice touch).  It also comes with a hard plastic travel case (that doubles as a charger).  The included AC adapter plugs into either the case or the stand but not into the razor. Note that the razor runs off of the battery only (can not run off of the AC adapter). One complaint with the charger is that the manual says not to leave the charger plugged in (more of an inconvenience). This is offset by the fact that the battery fully charges in less than an hour.

Even though it's not perfect, I really recommend this shaver. If something would happen to it, I would replace it right away.",1197331200,0,0,0,0,1

I used this while cutting my Husband's hair and noticed this only covered his shoulders about 6 or 7 inches down the back and left a gap in the middle.
There is not a snap to secure the cape. It is 2 metal hooks that can attach to each other at the end of the elastic gathering neckline. Normally you see this type of hook with sewn in loops or slots for the hook to latch to. The hooks can dig into the neck skin.
The neck area needs to be wider and adjustable more. My husband's neck was very tight in the cape, and it was uncomfortable for him.
The material is a soft nylon with Japanese style graphics and the hair just glides off the cape and onto the floor as expected.
The item needs an updated description as it currently states velcro neck enclosure and also a snap closure with elastic neck. I would also recommend less frontal material and bring some of the material to the back to provide more coverage on the shoulders and back in the design.

The main ingredient Acetyl Hexapeptide 3 (ARGIRELINE) is also used in Janson Beckett Alpha Derma CE, and cost less than this cream for 4 oz and has better ingredients (like DMAE, soy proteins, vitamins etc). I tried both and they work similar.
If someone really wants to get rid of wrinkles, scars, acne etc I recommend retinoids,for half price of this cream. This is the best active ingredient for the skin, all you need then is good sunscreen for daytime (as vit A must be used at night and is photosensitive PLUS start with lower % as it is very strong). All the miracle, secret creams work only on the top of the skin instead inside, building up collagen.

These brushes come enclosed in a nice case that has an individual slot holder and a flap that protects the bristles.  The case can then be rolled over and tied for easy carrying and storage for your brushes.  I have used all of these brushes and found that each brush seems to be soft bristles, and designed to do different makeup applications.  Love each of these brushes.  Although the brushes weren't super saturated with makeup, I went a head and washed them to test the durability of the bristles.  Once washed with a mild brush wash they dried nicely and the bristles remained soft and I had no fibers falling out of the brush.  Each brush handle is wood and painted pink.  Love the girly factor.  Handles fit in my hand well and I had no issues with makeup application..
I received a beauty sponge.  It worked well with liquid foundation application ( just remember to wet and squeeze the water out of it before using) the sponge is super absorbent so if not wet it will absorb the makeup just like any beauty sponge.
This sponge is nice and soft and washed up well also.
Overall I am very satisfied with this set of brushes.  Bristles are soft and provide great makeup application.  Great case for portability and for freeing up space on your makeup vanity.

it was an unnecessary device, meant to profit even further off a
hundred-dollar-plus toothbrush. My first thought when I received the
box was, ""Hmm, bigger than I thought."" I read the directions first,
which seemed to require an unusual number of steps to set up and
install the UV bulb. I only noticed later in fine print, ""May come
with bulb pre-installed."" Indeed, that was the case. So I just had to
plug it in.

The outer case presents a pleasing blue glow when operating, and indeed it is easy to operate--just push one button, come back 10 minutes later, done! However, it seems focused on cleaning just the brush head. My real concern is about the dark nastiness that builds up inside the handle base, around the threads, and underneath the ""skirt"" at the base of the brush head. What are you doing about that, Philips?!

Does have little adapters for other brands of toothbrush heads. I thought it wasn't worth the counter space, and considering that a dip into rubbing alcohol would kill everything, too, I left it with my mom at home. She, too, was hoping it would kill the innards. My sister, whose brush-head was part of the initial cycle run, remarked a few days later that she wished she could have had the UV sanitizer when, while traveling, the brush head slipped out, fell to the ground, and was stepped on. Ew.

Anyway, if you're seriously OCD, maybe it's useful. But considering all the other sources of germs that you put into your mouth, your toothbrush shouldn't be a significant concern (again, just soak it in rubbing alcohol). Not worth it. Floss, brush, use Listerine.",1199923200,0,0,1,0,0

I love the fact that this serum is gentle and does not contain the harsh chemicals that most skin lighteners do because I prefer using products that have natural and botanical ingredients as much as possible. This product comes in a dark amber dropper bottle which protects the product from sunlight exposure. It also contains Glycolic and Kojic Acids as the key ingredients which I believe will lead to clear and brighter looking skin. This serum keeps my skin smooth, shining and flake-free. It is not greasy and does not form a film. I have somewhat sensitive skin which is pone to irritation and redness, but this serum is very gentle without causing any breakouts or negative side effects. I believe it has been gradually improving my dull looking appearance by making the spots a bit lighter.

I use the product as directed after cleansing, toning my face and allowing some time to dry before topping with my regular moisturizer. This light weight clear serum not only applies smoothly and evenly, but it also has a fresh light scent that will dissipate after it dries. It has a liquid gel like texture which leaves my skin soft and smooth, not to mention it is also fast absorbing without any uncomfortable feeling and leaves my face quite moisturized. I have even started using it to lighten the sun spots on my hands and the results are impressive. Although I have not been using it for long, my skin tone has started to look more even and I have also noticed that some of my blemishes have cleared up along the way. My darker spots still exist, but they look much better and I can see some significant improvements of my lighter ones.

I am sure everyone's skin is different, but I have experienced zero sensitivity or dryness. I love how much clearer my skin looks throughout the day and my skin feels more balanced. My overall appearance is much brighter and smoother. The brown spots on my hands are slowly fading in under two weeks and I can say that I am really happy about it. In fact, everybody's skin type is different and the effects may not be the same or visible for everyone. I have used it twice a day for quite some time now and the brightening effect seems to be progressing. There is no miraculous or overnight whitening as such, but with gradual fading of sun spots, my face does appear clearer and even toned. This product does what it promises and lightens my dark spots. This is a great and reasonably priced dark spot corrector serum that I will definitely buy again and I feel quite confident to explore other products from the same line to further improve my skin conditions.

1702,3,"12 17, 2007",A2V1J3JT5OOZFO,B000PKKAFK,"I have used Norelco shavers for many years and prefer them to all other models I have tried. This review comes from much experience with the brand.

This Arcitec design looks fancy and works well, but gets three average stars because it really works no better than the previous non-space-age, less expensive designs. The 1050, 1060, and 1090 all operate the same, they just have a different display: none is better than the other, and don't waste money on the Cleaner accessory. It is fairly comfortable to hold (I prefer the feel of the original model because this is one is smaller), and looks fancy sitting on the counter, but it does not do a better job. It requires cleaning after each use as there is no space for the hairs. I have always cleaned my shavers after each use anyway. Unless you just want the apperance, it is not worth the extra money.

Technically: The triple-blade per round head (each cutter has three spinning blade areas) does not do any better than a double cutting blade. Kind of like a Saturday Night Live skit in the 70's, Jim Belushi said, ""Buy a triple bladed razor. For those that will believe anything"". Lift-and-cut is a ridiculous concept and a marketing ploy, but Norelco's do a nice job. Norelco went back to more diagonal openings with this model, which is good. Many other newer models have lots of little pin-holes which are worthless, as the hairs have no time to enter a small hole with shaving motion. You would have to set it directly on a hair to cut it. The less pin-holes the better.

Feel: The head design feels better on the neck, and has not caused razor-burn if I do not stretch the skin tight like I need to with the original model. It takes the same time to shave as my older unit, and I get no better results, no faster. It takes the same time to get a smooth shave, and the same persistance in some areas.

Function: It is a little bit easier to shave under the nose, above my mustache, but not a major difference. It is much harder to trim my sideburns with this unit as the heads almost cut my hair on my head above the ears the way it is shaped. Very poorly designed trimmer, so I use my older shaver for that.

Battery: Early, new battery life is good, as with most new battery devices. But, it states to not over-charge. Meaning, you need to be around when recharging to unplug it after it is charged; not good for those that shave and must go to work. The other units would shut off after charging.

Cleaner/Charger: Again, one needs to be around when it is finished to not over-charge. The cleaner is not necessary and a waste of time, money, and chemicals. I use a razor brush from an older unit, brush it out quickly over the wastebasket (one can't blow it out without getting hair dust all over the bathroom, and it can't be shaken into the wastebasket as easily as the older models), and I spray it quickly with Remington Silicone Lubricant (I can only find it at Wal-Mart, which is the only thing I ever go there for, by the way).

Overall: Buy it for looks and keep your old one in the drawer for sideburns. Nicer on the neck.

I would return it, BUT, it was a gift, AND I like the look of it. I know, I know!!

6642,5,"07 1, 2016",AYABRBZUMRLXQ,B019IMB8TM,"This makeup brush set includes a broad range of 10 brushes that are suitable for makeup professionals as well as home makeup application.  Each one is made from high-density synthetic hair and are engineered for the perfect combination of softness and firmness.  They are optimized for holding, applying and blending fine cosmetics.  The ends are dyed blue for a unique look.  The set features rounded, angled, tapered and flat brushes so there's one for every purpose and product from applying foundation to blush to eyeshadow and more.  They work with all forms of product including powders, creams and liquids.  Now you'll always have the right brush for every facial area, for each application technique and every type of product.  The black wooden handles are ergonomically designed for optimal comfort.

Whether you are an old hand at applying your makeup or just beginning, it doesn't matter if you use designer brand makeup or drugstore brand cosmetics, if you don't have quality application tools, then you're ultimately just wasting your money.  Granted, when it comes to makeup brush sets, the possibilities could be endless, however in actuality you only need 7 specific brushes.  This kit has everything you would possibly need.  Although some experts say to buy your brushes a la carte, I prefer to buy them as a set so that you know you're getting the same quality with each brush type.

Whether you choose synthetic or natural hair bristles is a matter of personal preference.  I know I've mentioned this before, but I personally have two sets of brushes.  One set is natural and the other is synthetic and I enjoy each one for different reasons.  However, when all is said and done, I have found that my synthetic brushes are more durable and stand up better to regular cleaning.  The synthetic bristles don't trap product nor do they absorb pigments, so your colors are less likely to run together when using highly pigmented cosmetics such as eyeshadow or blush.

Now, I'm not going to even try to say that this affordable set of brushes are better than designer brands because quite frankly they aren't better.  However, I will say that they work just as well as my more expensive brushes do.  They are comfortable to use and they come in a very travel friendly case.  I like to keep this set in my 'Go Bag' so that I always have the right brushes available when I'm not at home.  There's no need to pack my 30+ brush sets when all I really need are the 10 brushes in this set.

This brush set includes one of each of the following brushes:  precision round brush for eyeshadow and eye primer, angled contour brush for blush and bronzer, small flat brush for stipple concealer application, small angled brush for contouring cheeks and side of your nose, small flat angled brush for applying concealer around your eyes, tapered contouring brush for harder to reach areas, angled blending brush for cheekbones and nose, flat blending brush for liquid and cream products, round powder brush for blending powder products and a small tapered brush for concealer application on hard to reach areas.  That makes this the perfect travel or starter kit for all occasions.

The best part is that these quality brushes won't shed their bristles or lose their colorant and they are completely odor-free.  Add that to their 100% money back guarantee and you have the perfect set of brushes to get the perfect look you desire.  I highly recommend them for every application skill level.

Honestly, if I use this and then use regular floss string afterward, I never have anything come out on the string. I love this Waterpik! My teeth feel so clean after using it.

It is easy to use. You just fill the basin with water, pick your setting with the dial, and turn it on. It is a little messy - water run off - but it is worth it! I use it on the highest setting with no discomfort or pain at all. The different heads are all very useful and store right in the lid of the basin. It flips open and there is a compartmnt to keep them all. The coiled cord stays neatly in place in the holster when not in use.

I use a basin full of water, then refill with half water/half mouthwash and my mouth and teeth feel so clean and so smooth. It feels like I just left the dentist. It is also easy to clean from behind the teeth as well.

This is definitely one of the best investments I have made. I definitely recommend this wether you have braces or not. My kids even like using it. I bought extra heads for it so they each have their own and can just pop it on when they use the Waterpik.",1302220800,0,0,0,0,1

We have only used this serum for a couple of weeks and hardly noticed a difference. For myself, I only use it once a day on my face because I noticed it makes my skin dry and I don't have a good moisturizer so I only use it at night. For my son, I tell him the same thing, to use it at night. He uses it a couple of days during the week, just because he noticed his skin drying out also. I am going to keep using this serum for a couple of more weeks and see if we see a difference.

I also noticed my acne scars are starting to fade away and my skin is tightening up. Not that I have wrinkles yet, haha! I am going to keep using this serum for a couple of more weeks to see if I notice a difference with breakouts (acne) and see if more of my acne scars start to fade away more.

Serum is another word for light, smooth, and instantly absorbing oil. It's not really an oil but lotion doesn't make sense either. It's just a lovely few drops (you hardly use any) and it spreads all over your face and soaks in. You do not look greasy at all.  It's also not considered a moisturizer so you still need to moisturize.

My guess is that (pretend I took chemistry) the molecules or whatever that make this up are somehow smaller than lotion ones. So this goes on first, fills in the pores, leaves an even finish, almost like primer for your foundation. That's my uneducated guess. Because when you put on your lotion for night or day over this, it goes on smoother, you use less, and it feels like your face is smooth and also just a bit more hydrated.

Now, I grew up with a mom who slathered herself in Avon's night cream so much that I can barely stand anything Avon today. Just wore it like crazy and her pillowcase would crinkle after a day or two when that gunk dried.  This didn't show on my pillow case at all. It's completely absorbed, even with my Vichy night cream on top.  The bonus is, my kids can kiss me goodnight without being covered with Avon.

My big likes are that you don't use but a few drops, there's no fragrance issues, and it doesn't pill under foundation like some serums do during the day.

And best of all, my skin feels plumper and smooth: the only time it's okay to be plump in our society.

I had finished my old retinol serum, which I liked and was ready to purchase another bottle until I was asked to review this serum on my blog. I like that this product is light. It has the same lightness as OZ Natural's hyaluronic serum. A little goes a long way. Two pumps of the serum is the most you will need. The serum absorbs quickly into the skin. Allow a full minute to go by before you apply another product over it. That initial absorption you see is just ti drying faster on the top layer of skin. It takes about a minute for serums to absorb deeper into the skin. Allowing this time prevent the pilling when you a moisturizer too soon.

Give this product about four weeks to see any real results. Retinol products take months of use to see any impact on deeper issue like lines and wrinkles. Initially you will feel a surface difference where skin my feel smoother or even softer. A couple of weeks later you may see some lighter scars fading. If you are battle crow feet apply a little of this serum at the corners of your eyes (don't get the product in eyes though) before you apply your eye cream. The two working together will give you better results.",1444780800,0,0,0,0,1

When it arrived, I remove it from the clear package, and found that it is basically the same as a hair straightener, except you don't plug it in. I was a little skeptical because Ive got extremely thick hair and using Brushes like this usually don't work for me. I gave it a try and to my surprise it actually was very effective.
With being able to hold it as tightly as you choose, it makes it so you're able to get it through your hair. You just put it at the top of your hair near the root and pull tightly down followed by your hair straightener. To my pleasant surprise it actually worked very well.
 I'm usually not that talented in being able to brush and straighten at the same time, but this actually makes it quite easy.

If what one is truly seeking is to improve cellulite, one wants a cellulite creme with caffeine OR with any form of retinoid. Or a plastic surgeon. This whole topic was just explored on an episode of The Doctors.

However, let's talk about what this brush is great for: exfoliating! One can do a light dry rub before a shower or a lighter rub during the shower (be careful, wet skin is more delicate). This will keep skin youthful if one follows up with a light moisturizer.

The brush is well-made, looks nice, and has held up well this week (it appears brand new even though it is hanging in my shower).

When I do this I am constantly breaking my pony tail holders.  Most pony tail holders are not for thick hair, they are for normal hair.  I finally found strong pony tail holders that don't break and hold my hair without damaging it.  I completely love this Set of 20 Solid Stretch Knot Ponytail Holders by HBY.

You do get 20 ponytail holders, mine came in a velcro holder which is nice cause it keeps your ponytail holders in place.  They are 2"" in diameter and stretch really well and nicely.  If you have thick hair, these will work so nicely in your hair.  It will hold your hair and you don't have to worry about the elastic ruining your hair.

These ponytail holders do not get tangled in my hair when I take it out either.  Now I know that it might be a little expensive, but these are hands down the best ponytail holders that I have used.  They are made well and the best quality.  I would pay this price over any chepo ponytails that I have to buy over and over.  I completely recommend these a 100 percent!

In the meantime I'm at that ""I need a haircut"" stage where I'm not sure what I want to do with it, so it's sort of half grown out, not long enough for headbands or to hold back, not short enough to really be a style, just unmanageable.

I decided what the heck and tried some Toni&guy plumping whip to see if I could whip it back into shape. The whip is a semi solid, sort of like coconut oil texture when it gets cool. The scent is very light and doesn't really smell of anything, no floral or perfume smell. The directions say to use a walnut size scoop, but since my hair is short I used about half that. Towel dry, scoop, put on hair, run through, dry. Easy enough, the whip didn't feel heavy on my fingers or hair, it rubbed through easily and I got out my blow dryer and went to work.

The crown and top of my hair plumped right up, and styled easily. I blew it flat by the ears so it wouldn't stick out and that worked too, so if you're doing a convoluted have lift half flat style this will work just fine. There is no residue feeling when I run my hand through my hair, and the volume probably increased by a good half.

I'm very pleased with the Tono&Guy (Liked the shampoo too, but that's another review) and my plump hair, now if my tummy would just get the memo I'd be set.",1393632000,0,0,0,0,1

When it arrived I realized we were dealing with a ""system"" as it came in a HUGE box full of multiple smaller boxes of components and accessories. The SensoTouch Shaver sort of has it's own little universe on my husband's bathroom counter right now and I wasn't expecting THAT. There's the razor itself, it's charging stand, it's cleaning box, the bottle of cleaning solution, the blade cover, the brush that cleans the moustache trimmer, and the travel case. All those gizmos serve good purposes and are nice to have in and of themselves, but my goodness... we've sort of gone beyond a quick morning shave and into the domain of manscaping at this point!

When it arrived, the battery was totally dead, so into the charger it went. Within about 90 minutes the battery was completely charged and ready to go. No fuss, no muss and no waiting overnight. That is a very nice feature - super fast charging. The power button is a flush push button on the front of the razor, easy to find and the power indicator is a row of L.E.D. lights going up the front of the unit with a futuristic look that just adds another touch of style to the whole look. Overall a really nice design.

The mustache trimmer pops in & out of the top of the unit just behind the trimmer blades easily. It works smoothly and did a nice job evenening up my husband's mustache. Though using too much pressure will result in a cut to the upper lip very quickly. The razor itself for actual beard/face shaving was close and did a fine job with only one real complaint from the man of the house. He groused about the fact that the blades missed some of the hair along his neck line requiring multiple passes over the same area. We're not sure why this happened - it may be the location of the area, it may be that the hair on the neck line is finer than the hair on the rest of his face or it may be something about the razor. What he did say was that shaving with a regular hand razor or his ancient Norelco electric razor he did not need to make multiple passes in the same way as with this new SensoTouch 3d Razor. So overall... he does like this razor and will continue to use it, but wishes it took up less real estate on his counter top.

They coexist, almost individually, in the soap, but they don't really blend together to make a nicer scent, if you get my drift.

PROS:
1. I WAS ABLE TO PICK MY COLORS AND DID NOT HAVE TO RELY ON THE WHIM OF A COMPUTER OR STOCK PERSON PICKING FOR ME
2 . I ASKED FOR TWO RED TOWELS, ONE GREEN TOWEL; ONE YELLOW TOWEL; ONE ORANGE TOWEL AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I RECEIVED

4. THE VENDOR REPLIED WITHIN AN HOUR AND LET ME KNOW THAT THOSE PARTICULAR COLORS WERE IN STOCK AND THAT HE WOULD SEND THEM OUT THE NEXT DAY
5. HE SENT ME THE NAME OF THE DELIVERER AND THE NUMBER OF THE TRANSACTION SO THAT I COULD FOLLOW THE PROGRESS AS SOON AS THEY WERE SHIPPED, WHICH WAS THE NEXT DAY
6. I ORDERED THESE ON A FRIDAY AND RECEIVED THEM AT 10:30 AM THE FOLLOWING MONDAY
7. THE COLORS ARE TRUE
8. THE FRINGE IS HEAVIER DUTY THAN THE TOWELS THEMSELVES WHICH MAKES THEM LOOK MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THEY WERE
9. VERY REASONABLY PRICED

CONS:

1. I SUSPECT THAT THE FRINGE ON ANY OF THESE TOWELS WHETHER HIGH HIGH QUALITY OR OF THE LESS EXPENSIVE VARIETY WHICH I PICKED, WILL BE A CHALLENGE IN THE WASHER.
2. I PLAN TO HAVE MINE DRY CLEANED AND LET THEM WORRY ABOUT THE FRINGE...OR THE FRINGE MAY REQUIRE IRONING AS MIGHT THE TOWEL
3. I HAVE NOT WASHED THEM, DO NOT PLAN TO DO SO, SO I CANNOT ADDRESS THEIR COLOR FASTNESS; HOWEVER, SHOULD I WASH THEM, I WOULD USE THE PRODUCT ""SHOUT"" TO INSURE NO COLOR RUNNING

FOR ME,, THESE ARE A GODSEND. I AM REALLY TIRED OF BUYING REALLY EXPENSIVE TOWELS FOR THE FRONT BATH WHICH SIT AND SIT UNTIL THEY ARE USED. NOW I CAN HAVE THOSE NICE THICK TOWELS FOR MYSELF IN THE BACK WHILE HAVING AND INEXPENSIVE  BUT EXOTIC LOOKING PRODUCT IN THE FRONT!",1440979200,0,0,0,0,1

With this one, he can apply it and head off to work without worrying about any weird odors.

Secondly, he liked that it didn't make his beard greasy like other oils. It absorbed nicely and made his beard soft and shiny. After combing the oil through his beard, it looked incredibly healthy, and was very manageable.

Overall, my husband definitely approves of this beard oil. It's simple, with only three ingredients, but absolutely effective and great for managing a wild beard.

I have been using sleep masks for awhile due to light sensitivity when sleeping. I don't usually wear them all night but when light wakes me up in the morning I will have it next to me or I will use them for naps. The FirstSilk is a rather large mask with an adjustable elastic strap in the back. The front of the mask is so large, it can be moved around to the proper eye and facial placement based on your build. I found this to be far more useful than the molded mask I recently tried. I also did not experience any annoying shifting while face sleeping. While I appreciate the molded masks for less pressure on the eyes, this silk mask is so lightweight, the pressure on my eyes did not bother me at all. It also does a good job at keeping out the light. It came with a set of ear plugs, a drawstring bag and a plastic case for the plugs. Overall I like this mask and the current price of $11.99 seems very reasonable for a silk product.

Theyre nothing like the real beauty blender and they're just an absolutely waste of money.  I will be 100% honest, I did not have high hopes for these sponges, BUT I wanted the little stands and two stands at this price would still be a great deal.  You get three different products and Im going to break down the quality of each product for you.

First up is the actual sponges.  I have tried several off-brands of these and this is literally the closest thing Ive ever bought to the real beauty blender, without the super spendy price tag.  This is sponge is amazing!  I gave the 2nd sponge to a friend who didn't have the money to get a new one and she referred to this sponge as life and all I can say is my foundation has literally never looked better. I don't believe you can currently buy just the sponges, but Im hoping that will change!

Next you have the holders themselves. These are fantastic! Before I got this I would just store mine in a drawer and I know it probably wasn't the most sanitary practice for something you use to apply face makeup and this is literally so much better.

You also get a little pad thats great for cleaning your brushes.  I think you can also use it for your face, but I prefer to use it for cleaning my brushes as it works great.  Overall this set is just fantastic and well worth the price.  I cannot say enough how much I love the sponges and the holders.  I *thought* I had a fairly decent sponge before I received this one and I was so wrong.

8155,4,"06 27, 2016",AV294LXTZOL4Z,B00RW5XEZE,I have had experience with Jamberry Nails and this product is very similar except for one big thing. It does not require any heat to apply. The product comes with the sticker sheet with several sizes of nail stickers. It also comes with a set of directions a wooden cuticle pusher and a nail file. The concept is simple. All you have to do is cut the nail sticker to fit your nail and you peel and stick. Any edges that are too long you can use your nail file to precisely cut it along your nail Edge. I was a bit skeptical about this product as it does not require Heat and is basically just a sticker. I have had the product on for a couple days and have not had any lifting or any stickers removed. A couple of the leftovers I cut and put on my daughter's big toes. Which swimming and her bath they have also stage put. One thing I did notice with the skulls is that I put them upside down. The design is facing me instead of facing away from me. I noticed when I was done that the skulls bottom jaw and the school's head should be able to meet when you put your thumb and forefinger together. Also if you cut the sticker a little short from the edges of your nails you cannot tell a big difference. And I was able to easily do this to my right hand with my left and there was no drying time.

I can actually see my pores have shrunk and my skin looks taunter, especially the area around my forehead, nose and cheeks.

I will mention that applying the gel will probably seem a bit unusual.  The jar itself  is very pretty and once I opened it and touched the gel I thought I placed my fingers into mucus.  LOL

You must first wet your face and then apply a good amount to the face using circular motions. As you massage it into the face it will begin to lump together.  The only way to describe this is like taking rubber cement and rubbing it between your fingers until it forms a ball.  It is not a mask that you later peel off, it is used more like a scrub that peels away your old skin cells leaving your face feeling fresh and rejuvenated.  Even though I keep thinking I am using too much, I was shocked that after a week not even 1/4 of the jar is gone.  So the consistency is quite thick and goes a long ways.

You will definitely see results after a few days.  My skin felt silky soft and firmer.  If only I could use it on other areas of my body that could use some firming up.

I went from dry to oily to combination skin. Im tired of putting harsh chemicals on my skin. I recently made to switch to all-natural makeup, and Ive been looking for a brand to switch to all natural skin care. Hence, I was excited when I got to try out the Living Nature line at a discount.

The first thing that attracted me to this product is the fact that its made in New Zealand. I had the pleasure of visiting N Zed a couple years ago, and it was refreshing to see the high standards that the country has on organics the lack of pesticides, hormones and additives seen in meat, and how much fresher and better everything there smelled and tasted. Having been there, I automatically trust the products produced there more than I would anywhere else.

I have tried some products that after washing the soap off, i can't tell that I've washed, yet. I love that this gentle foaming cleanser suds up nicely and makes my skin feel clean, but not striped of moisture.  I followed this up by using Living Nature's Natural Body Lotion, and my skin feels great.  It used to feel itchy and look a bit ashy by day's end, but not my skin continues to stay soft and smooth throughout the day.

I also have to mention that I really love the natural smell that the products in this line have. It reminds of hiking through Karangahake Gorge and all the plant life you could smell whilst walking next to the raging river: damp, tropical, fresh, exotic.

I love using these products and can't wait to try others made by Living Nature.  Highly Recommend!",1467676800,0,0,0,0,1

Instead of whitening your teeth all at once (although that is a good option at the start) you may want to keep these around for occasional touch ups, important occassions and feel good moods.

The strips for upper and lower teeth are easy to use and don't seem to promote as much tooth sensitivity as other whitening procedures (like with the annoying gel). In fact, it almost seems to make your gums more healthy than before.

Probably the most pleasant whitening experience on the market with fairly good results. Why the box has a mirror in it, we will never know unless it is useful to see the results of the whitening. It would be difficult to hold the box and put the strips on your teeth.

I'd recommend trying these and then keeping a box handy for touch up use. Probably will whiten your teeth one or two shades on the first use.

We love the smell of lavender in our house. It is probably the top scent that we buy in all candles, waxes, etc. My original plan was to use this like potpourri. When the bag arrived and we smelled it, we had the brilliant idea to put it in our scent warmer (ceramic warmer that is warmed by an electronic light). It worked out so well! Our house smells like lavender and it is amazing.

These dried lavender blossoms are very potent too. We only used about half a handful. So, we still have almost the entire bag to use for later. It will last for a long time. These would also be great for making clothing bags. If you place a little bit in a cheesecloth type bag and place it in your drawers, it makes your drawer and the items inside smell incredible. I like to use them in my sock and underwear drawers.

I took a video and you can see that it fizzes like an explosion.  The scent is light and pleasant.  Each bomb is a one time use product, the entire bomb fizzes away in about 1 minutes leaving the scented water infused with a moisturiser.  I now tried a couple of different bath bombs, some generate bubbles like bubble bath but SpaGlo bombs do not.  There is a bit of foaming as the bomb fizzes and then the foam quickly disappears. Overall a very pleasant and relaxing experience.

What can be better?  The packaging is pretty but the teal netting on the package is covered with sparkles which fall off and it takes quite a bit of work to clean them up.  Sparkles give a pretty effect, but I hate the extra clean up - sparkles stick to the floors and counters and it took cleaning with a wet cloth Swiffer to get them all.  I would have been happier with a plain teal netting. This is a 5 star product, but I did not like the packaging. Based on my experience if you open the package on a newspaper you can avoid the clean up.

This bath bomb is provided by SpaGo.

I had high hopes for this bag of lavender from Pre de Provence, but I have to admit that I was a little disappointed. Lavender should have a fresh scent and a nice purple color. The range of purple can vary between varieties, but should never be dull and gray.  I took a photo of this lavender next to a tin of lavender I bought a few months ago from Fairview Lavender Farm in Kentucky, and you can see a huge difference. The scent is also fresher in the tin than in the bag from Pre de Provence. I have ordered bulk dried lavender blossoms from Provence and it's not always as nice as domestic lavender, but it's rarely this dull.

That said, the scent is nice and it will work well in a loosely covered dish or sachet where appearance doesn't matter as much. I would probably refresh this lavender with a pure lavender oil after a while. It's okay, but it wouldn't be my first choice in dried lavender blossoms.",1504742400,0,0,1,0,0

I first found it online by doing a search for things with pumpkin in it, and now I'm on my 4th bottle of this and I also recommend the body lotion and face creams, I am slowly becoming totally enamored with this brand and always look forward to trying more things.

This wash beats soap anytime in the shower; the orange gelee collapses on itself when poured and feels cool and refreshing especially in the morning. I love the scent, its very delicate, smell like soft fruit scented air, nothing aggressive and doesn't feel too organic and strange but fancy enough. There is ginko biloba and cucumber water, green tea, chamomile, orange and of course carrots, silky aloe, cleansing Dead Sea water and even spirulina extract, which I have drank before but never used in products. It feels very light and my skin always feels clean but light, never dry and uncomfortable. The bottle is also large and lasts a while, which is nice.

As I get older it becomes more important to me to use as little chemicals as possible, of course in today&iexcl;s world we are bombarded with them and its hard since they appear in everything but still, ever little thing counts. Parabens for example are used as preservatives and are generally considered safe because of low levels of toxicity, but lately I keep reading how traces are found in cancer lumps especially in women and simply knowing that a cosmetic doesn't have it makes me happy. And I love my cosmetics almost as much as books, the bathroom is always stacked : )

It is nice that I do not need to buy different products to clean the different parts of my little one for this is like a head to toe wash.  A very wonderful feature of this is that it is made with natural ingredients that bring natural goodness to my babys skin.  It is free from parabens, sulfates, or phthalates, and other harmful or worrisome chemical ingredients which you get to find in some baby shampoos.  Babies are very much vulnerable to exposures to hazardous chemicals so we really have to do the choosing in wisely manner.  Thus, this a safe and gentle shampoo that makes your baby clean and smell so good!  This is actually free from fragrances, but because it does a very good job of cleaning our precious one, he does smells so nice after every wash of this.  This does not sting their eyes, which is really very nice.  The pump was also very nice. It is very convenient to use. I totally like using this shampoo and will continue to do so.

A small dab is all that is needed to adequately work through the hair. The product easily rinses out and does leave a nice, silky finish that holds up for hours on untreated hair.

But if my memory is serving me correctly, the Lustray Spice is  more subtle and  a little less cloying than the Lilac Vegetal and Bay Rum. I love it and will continue to purchase along with Clubman's original aftershave. If forced to select between the two, I would take the original Clubman because the scent is stronger and lasts longer. But this product is much cheaper. Lustray is owned by Clubman, so it's no surprise that they all have similarities. If you like the original Clubman aftershave, you may like this. At the price it sells for on Amazon, it can't hurt to try it.

These arrived super quick and in great condition from packaging being done right! I have a makeup brush obsession so when I seen these gorgeous brushes, I couldn't turn them away! They are just as great as I hoped for as well. They withheld their first cleaning without any shedding of the hairs and they dried super quick. The bristles are super soft, yet can withstand both liquids and powders without any signs of losing shape or bristles. Each brush comes individually wrapped in a cellophane bag. When opened there was an overwhelming solvent smell. It was is if the handles had been finished and put directly in the bag before they were dry. But the handles are dry. In fact the finish is very nice and smooth. The smell coming of just one is enough to give me a headache. I had to wash these with dish soap and olive oil right away, the smell was very off-putting.  The ferule is professionally glued to the handle and bristles, so they will never fall apart like others.  I received these at a discount to test and review, and these may easily become some of my main brushes.

Bristles are synthetic but they are so soft that feels a lot like natural, also they are very dense and the benefit of using these very dense synthetic brushes is they are perfect for either powder, cream or liquid products, it's very hard to get them stained as long as you take good care of them.

These brushes are really well made. The handles have a great weight to them and are very sturdy. The bristles are well attached and do not come loose at all. I have already cleaned them once and they hold up perfectly. The bristles are SO soft, which is awesome because the brushes do not irritate my skin at all. Having soft bristles is especially important for applying make up to the delicate skin around the eyes. Another thing I really like about this pack is the variety of brushes that you get. They are different not only in size but also in shape of the bristles. It is important to use the correct brush for the application you are doing and this pack makes that easy.  I actually washed them again a couple more times and let them dry out and that pretty much got rid of the smell. These are now my main foundation, contouring, blush and eye shadow brushes. They work very well and I have no complaints.",1462406400,0,0,0,0,1

This is a cute versatile 9 pack of girl headbands.  Each one is different with a different centerpiece.  The headbands are stretchy and they fit comfortably on a baby's head.  The material seems to be decent and made well.

The headbands are pretty and there hasn't been any issue of them sliding off.  I feel that these are nice for newborns and even toddlers to accessorize with their outfits.

Pre de Provence has given me a sweet-smelling way to do this with its French Lavender mist. The scent is a light, enjoyable, very natural smelling light lavender, which is known to be a stress reducing, calming essential oil. In this case of the Pre de Provence mist, the scent is not an essential oil, but is listed as ""fragrance"" with unspecified ingredients. It still is a nice scent. The sprayer is adjustable, and I prefer to use it as a fine mist. Instead of misting my sheets before getting into bed, I mist them when I am making my bed. If you prefer to mist them in the evening, I recommend waiting a few minutes before getting into bed to avoid the wet spray. If you've never misted your linens, Pre de Provence French Lavender mist is a nice starting point for an experience you'll want to have over and over.",1504137600,0,0,0,0,1

These are high heel pad caps for protecting your heels in any sort of soft ground.  They are incredible for outdoor weddings and parties.

I'm a bit of a wimp when it comes to the mouthwash burn, so the strength of it is usually the first thing I notice when trying out a new mouthwash. My husband who seems immune to the strength of every mouthwash out there, seems fine with this Crest formula and has no problem washing with it. I haven't had any issues with this mouthwash turning my teeth colors or causing any kind of build, and neither has my mouthwash addicted husband. So it seems to work well. It leaves your breath smelling great and lasts quite a while. I like this wintergreen version a bit more than the mint, since I've always been a fan of the more refreshing taste of wintergreen.

One thing I do appreciate is that Crest did not use Yellow #5 food coloring to make this mouthwash, since most companies use that color to produce the green hue in their products (including Scope). Some people, myself included, have a sever food allergy to Yellow #5 and can't use or eat anything with that food coloring it it. For those with this condition, note that Crest has used Yellow #6 instead to create the mouthwashes green color. The Crest Pro-Heath mouth wash in the Invigorating Clean version, which is an even greener colored mouthwash, also doesn't use Yellow #5, and used #6. So anyone with this food coloring sensitivity who wants to try these out, can do so knowing these won't have Yellow #5 in them.",1365638400,0,0,0,1,0

Wait a minute birds? Yes birds. Dawn is used exclusively in all animal rescues from the exon valdez to the BP spill. The International Bird Rescue Research Center refuses to use anything else in fact. The veterinarians like its gentleness and toughness on gooey oil. They use it every day and wash their own hands with Dawn and it doesn't dry them out.

Dawn is made by procter and gamble, and they have donated over 500 thousand dollars to wildlife groups from the sales of Dawn. I prefer the ultra  original to the platinum as I find the platinum is a little harsher on my hands. The ultra works great for getting dried egg off of my dishes, and put a little in a pot to soak come back and rinse it out with a light brushing.

There are greener cleaners out there as veterinarian and head of the International Bird Rescue Research Center points out, but none of the has dawns magic she says. Dawn has petroleum in it as an ingredient. Probably why it moisturizes / doesn't dry out your hands.

I went home and started using the Sonicare I had bought but never plugged in. That was good, but not enough - I bought a Waterpik because obviously flossing wasn't cutting it.

I had never used a Waterpik before, and it was some revelation! I'm still amazed that there are some Waterpik oldtimers who say this machine isn't strong enough...uh, for what? Peeling paint off a brick wall? This thing absolutely knocked my socks off when it came to the PRESSURE.

I started out at 2 and worked my way up to 7 - it still stings like mad, but I'm getting used to it by now. I put Listerine in the tank to increase the anti-bacteria result.

My dentist went on vacation, and I had to cancel another appointment, so it happened that almost two months had elapsed since the last time I had seen him. In that time, I faithfully brushed with the Sonicare four times a day and used the Waterpik at least once (several tankfuls of water and Listerine worth.)

Regarding the leaking people talk about - the only time the tank leaks, I notice, is if I put my fingers on the seal when I'm refilling it. If I'm careful to keep my fingers away from that seal, the tank is water tight.

So when I returned for my check-up, the dentist was AMAZED. He wasn't sure what I had done, but he said my gums looked pink and healthy! He had said initially I'd have to get my teeth cleaned every three months because I must be one of those people who gets a tartar build up quicker than other people...well, I had worked religiously on scaling back the plaque. (I had also bought a dental mirror so I could check the back of my front teeth for telltale plaque residue.)

Hmmm, no comment about that plaque...was it because there WASN'T any? My dentist asked me if I had been eating because there was so little build up (I had to tear that out of him because I KNEW he didn't want to give me credit for working that hard on my dental hygiene!)

1) I don't want it to shred
2) I don't want it to be stuck between my teeth
3) I want it to do the cleaning
4) I don't want the flavoring on the floss to be too noticeable

I have tried a number of different floss, and keep coming back to Glide Floss simply because it works the best.  It feels good on my teeth and my fingers holding the floss. It never breaks when I use it.  It never shreds, it glides easily between my (tightly packed) teeth. You can do the cleaning in one pass, it digs out whatever happen to be stuck in there very well. With other floss I feel I need to make a second pass sometimes, but not with Glide.

Flavor: Glide comes in two packaging. Photo attached. One has silver packaging and one has greenish packaging. The silver packaging has no mint flavor, the greenish package has mint flavor (not terribly strong but noticeable). The describe of the package for silver package mentioned ""deep protection"" and for green package mentions ""multi-protection"". I don't feel or see the difference between the two other than one has flavor and the other one does not. I did not notice the mint flavor mentioned on the package. I have a slight preference for no flavor, so if I knew I would have picked the silver package.

In term of price Glide is a little pricier than other floss. To me it is worth it. The best price on this 6 packs I found at Costco, especially when they run a coupon in their flyer. Amazon price is is decent, but fluctuates. I found a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices and allows you to generate alert emails when the price reaches the desired price. If you enter ""price history alert"" in Google it will be come up at the top, it has the word camel in the name. I find this tool to be very helpful.

Coincidence or not? I noticed that when I use my Glide floss my hygienist compliments me on my flossing!

He was pretty good about using his Waterpik Ultra, mouthwash rinse, and brushing, but I felt he brushed for too short of the time.  I liked that this brush had a brushing timer and the quadpacer feature.  Now, my son uses the brush for two minutes while getting prompts from the brush to switch brushing to different areas of his mouth (the quadpacer prompts could be slightly stronger to be more noticeable).  My wife and I have been using a Sonicare Essence brush for several years now, so we were familiar with the brand, the quality, and benefits of Sonicare.

Other notable features are:  a. the vibration strength selector, which can be set to lower strength for younger kids, and b. the ability to use smaller brush heads - HX6032/64 - for younger kids (4-7 years old) and bigger ones - HX6042/64 - for older children(7-10 years old).

The included stickers were a nice touch.  My son liked them, and he decorated both the brush and the stand, plus he decorated his Oral-B CrossAction electric toothbrush and that brush's stand...  Well, there were plenty of stickers included.  We had to first attach the included white plastic panel to the front of the brush and then attach a decal to that panel.  I am not sure what the purpose of the white panel is or why could not it be attached at the factory.  In general, I prefer as few parts as possible on a toothbrush to prevent places where water can get in and mold can grow, and I feel like it can grow under that plastic panel.  The sticker on the handle took a couple of days of smoothing corners before the corners stopped curling, but it is fine now.

My biggest gripe with Sonicare is the cost of the replacement heads.  They seem to always be more expensive than Oral-B's, and there are no generic replacement heads available like there are for Oral B.  For example, a 3-pack of Oral-B replacement heads costs $19 ($6.33 each).  Sonicare replacements for this brush cost $19 for 2 ($9.50 each), although, currently, with a $4 off coupon, they are $7.50 each, which is still more expensive than Oral-B replacements.

Overall, I like the brush for the features, and my son enjoys it.  I dislike the cost of refills.  As an option, I would look at Oral-B 5000 which is more expensive, but occasionally has discounts that bring the price to as low as $71.  The extra $26 over the price of this brush, in my opinion, can be easily justifed considering that the Oral-B brush has more features.  Additionally, the Oral-B refills are cheaper and the Oral-B's battery can be replaced once it wears out, which is not the case with the Sonicare.",1389052800,0,0,0,1,0

6247,5,"11 16, 2015",AMLOQUXG3USTY,B013VZRLB6,"This contouring kit is so much fun! I've been playing with contouring a little over the past few months but was trying to piece everything together with random finds at the stores and as a beginner it was hard to pick the correct colors I need to do a true contoured look. Having this palette with so many choices makes it easy for me to play and perfect my look. The powder goes on well and the colors transfer great onto skin. Using powder instead of a heavier concealer or foundation gives it a Much softer look and not like I've caked a bunch of crap onto my face. They blend together well and last all day. They include an ebook tutorial on contouring tips and tricks in an email after purchase and I found it to be extremely helpful. There are also about a billion and one videos in YouTube that show you clearly step by step. I am much more confident in my makeup application now and can't believe how easy it is with the right tools. There is a good amount of powder of each color and I think this palette will last me a long time. There are many colors to fit just about every skin tone and color, a fantastic starter kit! I love it!

I did receive my contouring makeup palette free or at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes.

I was keeping them in a container in my drawer but that was not only unorganized, but super messy as well.

This acrylic stand is perfect for displaying and storing your oval makeup brushes.  So basically this is two pieces of sturdy and durable acrylic and you just put it together with the two included screws.  Once you put it together you have the perfect stand to organize and display your oval makeup brushes.  The holder is maybe a foot or a foot and a half long and its not very big width wise at all.  I don't have a very big vanity but Im able to place this on top of it and it fits fantastically.  If you have oval makeup brushes this stand is an absolutely must have.

8881,4,"04 8, 2016",A2PF6BJMN72RC1,B01D527Z3E,"I have been using a lot of essential oils lately, mainly for diffusing. There are a few brands that I have come to trust, and after a few years, I finally feel safe in venturing to create some oil blends. This set of amber glass bottles will be the perfect receptacles for my new oil blends.

I really like that the bottles come with glass droppers as opposed to those stoppers that most essential oil bottles have in them. I have found that using those stoppers is really a crap shoot. Some work great, some don't let any oil out, and some may as not be there because the oil pours out of them. I plan to use the droppers from these bottles to get the oil out of my other bottles, so that I can ensure the right ratio of oil to oil.

The bottles don't leak when closed properly. I tested them by filling them with water and turning them upside down. The droppers work perfectly and I can control how many drops of which oils go into my new blends, and then I'll be able to keep track of the blends I like best and how much of what went into them. I'll feel like a potions student from Hogwarts, but that's fine with me. I'm really looking forward to coming up with some blends that are good enough to give as gifts.

I do wish that the bottles had come with labels. I have some labels that I use for the lids of my other oils, but since these have droppers and are 1-oz. bottles, they'll be able to accommodate larger labels. So now I need to go label hunting, and I'll be all set. I do appreciate that the bottles are thick amber glass, because that will protect my oils from outside light and keep them fresher longer. I feel that the bottles are a great value for a set of 12, and I would definitely recommend them.

I received the bottles free in return for my honest review. My reviews are done in compliance with Amazon's TOS and FTC regulations, and I never guarantee a favorable review. I have personally tested this product.",1460073600,0,0,0,1,0

I had some scars cause by surgery that I really badly wanted them to be off of my sight.  Luckily, trying this out and being consisted with applying it gave very nice results to skin.  This item is one of the best practical ways in reducing the look of scarring.  It did produce a good result in the appearance of my scar. This has a variety of features and benefits.  I liked that it is mostly made of organic or natural ingredients which makes me believe that my skin is being fed and nourished in the inside with all of its natural goodness. After several usage, I was able to tell the difference from the time I had not used anything on my scar and now that I have been using this.  It did diminished that unwanted bad looking skin and I am hoping that eventually with my continuous application, it will totally disappear.  This lotion is not sticky as well and is absorb fast by the skin.  It also gives good moisture.

A friend recently told me about Dexe Root Touch Up, I ordered it immediately, and I've used it several times. There's still plenty more left in the box, too, so I plan to go a very long time (three to four months -- maybe longer) before I dye my hair again. (Then again, if I had an important function to attend, I would dye my hair and not depend on this!)

Certain parts show more than an inch of gray -- where my hair is parted, of course and at the crown toward the back. It takes about a minute to cover those areas. Gray at the temples and in front of the ears is a little trickier because, even using the narrow part of the brush, the black waxy-talc substance gets on my skin. It looks like soot. Fortunately, it wipes right off my skin with a dry washcloth, while remaining on the hair. My hair is now very silvery, very white in some places and fairly coarse. This still covers it well and doesn't stand out too differently from the rest of my hair which is dyed with VS Sassoon Salonist Neutral Black #1/0.

I do see a little residue on my pillow case. I have to reapply this after shampooing. It does lend a certain ""matte"" or dull feel to hair where it has been applied.

Overall, I really like this product!",1466121600,0,0,0,1,0
6201,5,"03 8, 2016",A1KJG1DXMN6YY9,B01258J0I2,"I have been using a lot of Shea butter in homemade lip balms and lotions that I have been making recently. I love shea butter so much that I wanted to order some that I could use on its own in place of my lotion when I get out of the shower. When I saw this one and I read the claims and reviews, it seemed like exactly what I was looking for. I placed the order and this was shipped to me very quickly. This came sealed well with a safety seal intact under the lid. The texture of this is SO thick and creamy, and it melts into the skin as you work it into your skin with your hands. If any scent at all, this is very mild and organic smelling. I have used this after getting out of the shower, and I don't feel like I will ever use lotion over this shea butter ever again. This is very concentrated, so I take a bit and warm it up in my palms before rubbing it into my skin. This leaves my skin (which is REALLY DRY this winter) feeling really soft and not greasy at all. There are so many harsh chemicals and fragrance in lotions. My mother passed away of cancer last year, and every since she got sick, I have tried my best to clean up my body. I think that switching over to pure shea butter instead of lotion that always has so many chemicals is a step in the right direction. I am really happy with the benefits that I am receiving in using this product, and I would recommend this. I received this product (very kindly) at a discounted rate during a special promotion.

And at 4 oz, this is a pretty good size bottle of moisturizing cream, but the price of $19.99 is not cheap. That's not drugstore price but department store price. Is it worth it? The issue I have is that it has a lot of the common chemicals used for those run of the mills everyday hand cream. Of course I prefer my skin care products to be all natural, but I do understand that using chemical ingredients yield a more stable product and also convince the mind to think it is of high quality. For example, dimethicone, which is in this product, is a silicone derivative that gives the skin an immediate feeling of smoothness, but it does not actually improve the skin. I can even look pass that, but at this premium price I did not expect to see mineral oil as one of the ingredients. My Dollar Store moisturizer is made of mostly mineral oil.

I bought this as a hand cream, but I noticed that the webpage says this is a facial moisturizing cream. I think it is ok as a hand cream but I would hesitate to apply it regularly on my face.

It was nicely packaged in a glass bottle and boxed. I put some on my wrist and let it settle. There was something sharp and bitter under a somewhat true blooming rose scent. It is very strong, like an attar. I compared it to my Auric Blends Rose and my Auric Blends Tea Rose. I have to say I prefer the Auric Blends original Rose over the Kuumba. That is after wearing it all afternoon to make sure I gave it a chance. I've also been looking to try Stella McCartney's EDP, which contains a rose note, but most of the commercial perfumes/fragrances lack the warmth and depth of a natural perfume. If you are after a true garden rose scent, Kuumba is worth trying to see if it agrees with you. I also recommend the two Auric Blends I mentioned.",1456963200,0,0,0,1,0

The toothbrush has 5 settings, and it lists them in the description.  I prefer the sensitive setting, as I recently had gum surgery and am now very aware of how hard I am brushing, which leads me into that nice feature.  This toothbrush will slow and the red light will come on if you are brushing too hard.  I like that, because it reminds me to use lighter pressure.  It comes with a separate display that keeps track of how long you are brushing, and also has a clock.  The brush pauses when it is time to switch sides.  I like the carrying case, as you can place the unit and the separate brushes in it.

I think it is a bit much with the display, personally.  The separate display portion is kind of a hassle.  I also wish it had a setting memory.  Every time you restart the toothbrush, it starts over at the first setting, so I have to press the arrow down to get to the sensitive setting.  It takes about 7 seconds, so you have wasted that time with the brush out of your mouth, trying to find the correct setting you like.

I like it, it works well, there are just a few things I would prefer be different.  I prefer a little more of a simplistic toothbrush.",1385251200,0,0,0,1,0

Drawing them on and filling them in can be so time consuming and it's hard to get them on just right so I thought this would be a great option.

I was skeptical because they are tattoos and tattoos can be tricky to apply.  I really wanted to like this product because I think it's a great concept and it seems so easy, but I had a very trying time.  The first step is to cut out the tattoo as close to the eyebrow as possible.  This was tricky.  Once I held it up to my eyebrow I could tell it would be unnaturally long so I had to trim excess and then trim the other eyebrow to match.  It took me several attempts to get one on.  I don't know if my washcloth wasn't wet enough or if I have too much hair for the tattoo to stick too but application was too much for me.  Then to try and apply the other side and make sure it matches was even more tough.  I was able to apply and wear for 2 days but I felt self conscious the entire time.

As painstaking as filling my eyebrows in is, that's what I'm going to stick to.

I don't really mean to, it just comes flying out of the bottle into my hand. I waste a lot of it. That doesn't happen with this aerosol foam formula. I press down on the top and the perfect amount comes foaming out. Awesome. This conditioner also washes out of my hair quickly. It doesn't feel heavy and thick like some other conditioners.

The conditioner itself smells amazing. It leaves a nice citrus aroma in your hair. Unfortunately, the scent does not last all day. After about an hour or so, I can no longer smell it. It does leave my hair feeling amazing. I didn't notice a huge volume improvement, but my hair is pretty thick to begin with. It did help with my frizz and my tangles.

Importantly this mouthwash doesn't burn like those brands containing high levels of alcohol. The amount needed for an individual rinse is relatively small thanks in part to the foaming characteristics of this wash. The taste is clean and not overpowering and leaves my breath fresher for a longer period of time. Make no mistake this is a superior brand to the everyday generic and even many of the national brands that I've tried.

The one detraction I have for this product and hence the 4-star rating is the price. At about $.25/ounce this is not cheap stuff. The last time I purchased a bottle of Scope I paid right around $.09/ounce. So take that for what it's worth. I do believe the Crest product is better.

To get the most out of the unit you have to read the manual. It clearly states that you should not leave water in the reservoir (why you would want to anyway is beyond me - why would anyone want to use stale water?). If you don't leave water in it, it won't leak out on your counter. Pretty simple equation there.

I agree with several others that the tongue cleaning attachments are basically useless. They don't fit into the holder anyway, so just toss them out. Sure, try it, but I'll bet you'll find it to be basically useless compared with a true tongue cleaner (i.e., a scraper type device).

The water reservoir could be a bit bigger - an additional 20% bigger would be nice. But, it's very easy to fill even when the unit is running (keep a glass of water handy and just pour it in when the water level is at the half-way point). Simple and easy, and the smaller reservoir does have the benefit of keeping the unit size nice and compact.

Sound level is very low compared with past WaterPik units. No, it's not silent, but it is no more noise than you would get with any other electric appliance in the bathroom such as an electric toothbrush or a shaver.  In fact, it is less noise than my shaver.

The auto-retractable hose is a very nice touch and keeps everything neat. Again, a couple inches longer would be nice, but there's the compact size trade-off again.

In actual performance - wow!  You will never believe that your teeth could get this clean! Wonderful feeling. There is a wide range of power adjustments ranging from very gentle to ouch! I've found setting the dial to the 5/6 range gives a good cleaning without any discomfort.

Good performance at a good price -- can't ask for more than that.",1176595200,0,0,0,0,1

It hurt when I walk and I wanted to know how best to remove it. In the past I used a real pumice stone on it as well as a metal file (Dr. Scholl's Callus Reducer) but was not fully satisfied with the results. The podiatrist recommended this Pumice Sponge Block. His office sold it for $4 (so a little cheaper than Amazon if you include the cost of shipping). The sponge did not look impressive. I was somewhat skeptical figuring they are just trying to find another source of revenue for the office. But since it was inexpensive I figured I would give it a try.

The doctors instruction were to leather the sponge up with soap and use it every time I take a shower. After using the Pumice Sponge he told me to use Amerigel Lotion Amerx -<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amerx-Amerigel-Care-Lotion/dp/B003T1SENM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amerx - Amerigel Care Lotion</a>. It has been three weeks since I began using this sponge/Amerigel and I am pretty impressed with the results. My callus no longer bothers me, and my foot feels smooth and soft.

I am attaching a photo of the sponge without a wrapper and at angle that gives you a better view than the official photo.

Anyway, my review will be based from my wife's experience since she is the one who is religiously using this every night.  This has become one of her important routines at night before bedtime.  She is now in her 30's and she is very much into slowing down the aging process that an eye cream or eye gel is an essential stuff for her to have.  She told me how nice this eye gel worked on her.  It did deliver the kind of result that she wanted.  I did notice on her for about several usage that her wrinkles and crows feet began to diminished.  Her eyes do not looked as tired as they were before even if there were some nights of less sleep for her. She said that it is very much moisturizing.  It is also not heavy on the eyes and eyelids.  This is also quickly or easily absorbed by the skin, thus the gel does not sit on top of the skin but deeply nourishes your skin from the inside. Her eyes do look very much refreshed upon waking up in the morning.  She is very much satisfied with how this gel works wonders in her eyes.  She loved it!

I bought this machine because the gum next to a molar became swollen and occasionally bled. Obviously, regular brushing and flossing with the string or tape were not fixing the problem. Using a jet of water I thought was more safe and clean than scraping with a metal pick or some other hard tool. And this machine is less expensive than another visit to the dentist so why not try it?

Two weeks of meticulous rinsing twice a day and the gum healed completely. I wish I had known there was a two-device deal: this machine plus a smaller, 'travel' flosser for less than buying the two things separately. I would have bought that set.

PLEASE NOTE: even though this machine claims to be more effective against gum disease than flossing with the string, gingivitis is a serious disease that can affect other organs such as the heart so should be treated seriously. If a dentist tells you that you have have gingivitis, using this machine with no other treatment may not be enough.",1385510400,0,0,0,0,1

However, I am giving this product 4 stars because it doesn't help me get a closer shave as it claims. When you use an electric razor you are supposed to stretch your skin a little bit to stand up the hairs so you can get close and I can do that much better and get closer when shaving dry.

I have been looking for a shampoo and conditioner that will help my hair be healthier and appear a bit more full. Toward this goal I had been using&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nexxus-Humectress-Conditioner/dp/B0007NIRUU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nexxus Humectress Conditioner</a>&nbsp;for decades, but they changed the formula and now it is terrible.

I came across Biolage Fortetherapie Strengthening Conditioner while searching for a good replacement for my old-formula&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nexxus-Humectress/dp/B0007NIRUU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nexxus Humectress</a>&nbsp;conditioner and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nexxus-Youth-Renewal-Rejuvenating-Shampoo/dp/B00AE07FUE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Shampoo</a>&nbsp;(which had a scent I didn't like and led to a strange incident covered in that review).  I replaced the shampoo with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Matrix-Biolage-Strengthening-Shampoo/dp/B003V2P32Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Matrix Biolage Strengthening Shampoo</a>&nbsp;which seems a set with Fortetherapie conditioner.

I've tried several other conditioners that were not really satisfactory and some just not acceptable.  Fortetherapie was like a breath of fresh air and left my hair feeling very nice. The scent is very mild and sort of like bamboo. It is almost no scent which pleases me.

With my below shoulder hair I used dollop about between the size of a nickel and a quarter then rub my hands together and work it throughout my hair. This amount seems to work well and helps make it easier to get my shower comb through my wet hair. It's not really a detangling conditioner for me, but it helps a lot and that is plenty good for me.

Rinsing it out takes longer than I expected. Hotter water helps clear it faster but too-hot may not be good for hair or scalp. I'm slowly trying to use less and less till I hit the right balance.

The bottom line is using&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Matrix-Biolage-Strengthening-Shampoo/dp/B003V2P32Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Matrix Biolage Strengthening Shampoo</a>&nbsp;and Fortetherapie Strenthening conditioner is leaving my hair and scalp feeling and looking better than I expected. My hair looks and feels clean longer and is very manageable.

I'll update the review with observations about the ""strengthening"" properties as I live with Fortetherapie conditioner longer.

First impressions are very positive and hopeful. I hope this will be helpful, especially for those of us who loved the original formula Nexxus Humectress conditioner.

Update: Jan 9 2014
Because of the rinsing issue I mentioned in the main review I have been using less and less of the Biolage conditioner each shampoo. I'm now using about half what I started with and it rinses easier and my hair looks and feels at least as nice.

What I'm using now seems less than what I would have thought would be effective. But happy surprise: it's like getting twice as many shampoos for the same money. It seems like my Biolage conditioner keeps getting better and better.

Update: Feb 15 2015

I think I'm using a little less than in the January update. A little less than a rounded nickel sized blob. This seems about right for my below shoulder length hair. I also can risse this amount more easily without resorting to very hot water. After a couple of months I feel my hair is either stronger or less likely to tangle and break. Whatever the case I got the same positive result.

Matrix Biolage Strengthening conditioner exceeds my original expectation even more now.",1388534400,0,0,0,0,1

Unfortunately, due to a patent infringement with Allergen, they had to take the bimatoprost out of it and as a result, the product no longer works for me.  I believe it may still contains some sort of prostaglandin but if so,  one that is less effective for me. I miss my long eyelashes.

I just ordered the Phillip Thomas Roth ""Lashes to Die For"", and we'll see if that works any better.  If not, I guess I'll bite the bullet and get Latisse, which is bimatoprost but which requires a prescription.  (And, which is way more expensive than the original Revitalash ever was.)

If you do choose to use an eyelash enhancer with prostoglandin, you need to be diligent - you have to use it nightly and it can take 8 weeks to see results.  People who use it sporadically for a few weeks and give it negative reviews aren't using it right.

The good: It's cordelss, recharchable, easy to clean, pivots, it's curved, it works well wet or dry, awesome with shave gel and it works well for the underarms and legs.  Obviously if you want silky smooth, a blade or wax will be much better.  The pop-up trimmer is great for stray hairs, or if you have a few days of growth.

What's so-so - using it to get silky smooth down under. If you don't like hair there, it's great for keeping the hedges in check.  If you like the bald look, it will get you there.  However, it will take time to go completely smooth versus using a razor. She says it's great for touch ups between blade shaves or waxes. For instance, she used it a lot during her pregnancy. In her case the results were better than expected, but she hopes that this will improve over time. It's probably a really good solution when you are traveling and are going to be wearing a bathing suit almost everyday - especially at the beach.  The salt water may not irritate the area that much.

What's bad: The bikini attachment is useless.  My wife didn't bother trying the attachment.  If you are looking to be smooth down under, you are better off using a trimmer (Panasonic makes one for women or Wahl for men) to cut things down to an easy length for shaving or preparation for waxing.  If you are looking to trim down there, again use a cordless trimmer.

Bottom line, it is a great shaver than cuts down on wasted money and waste with disposable razors.  Just remember it takes time for your skin to get used to an electric shaver.",1233273600,0,0,0,0,1

(I couldn't find any explanation online as to whether or not the tub version was different than the tube version, but figured I just buy this big tub since it was more cost-effective.)

Since it took a few days for this to arrive from Amazon, I was using a moisturizer on the burned areas, which wasn't really doing much.  As soon as I started using the Aquaphor, I noticed a big difference in how my skin was healing.

This tub is huge, especially since you only need a tiny bit of this.  I plan on divvying it up into smaller containers so I can keep them around the house.

It seems to have a ton of uses; I've been applying it not only on those patches on my hand, but also on dry areas on my face (a result of using Carac cream to remove pre-cancerous patches also), on my lips, on my heels at night, and also on my cuticles.  It works so well to lock moisture in!",1419984000,0,0,0,0,1

The Loofah strip side isn't very large, and I was hoping for it to be more effective at scrubbing than the one I have on a wooden handle.  The quality of the materials and strength of the handle strings are very nice.  What I don't like about it is that it takes 2 full days to dry in between using it.  That's my only concern because of the possibility of mold developing.  I can't squeeze it out very well because of my hands/fingers that are arthritic and painful.  I find it more than long enough to reach my feet and it wraps well around my shoulders, plus hangs easily from my shower head.  I bought it on a Lightning Sale so the price was fine.  I will keep this, but it is actually TOO soft for my back, as compared to my chunky and rougher Loofah on a long wooden handle.
I'll update this review in a few months should the wetness issue prove to be a concern.  I know this issue won't likely affect anyone with stronger hands, I just mention it for those who do not.

Okay maybe if the lancet was a little sharper that would be nice, but overall this is an amazing blackhead remover kit.  Before getting this kit I had one little black head remover tool that I rarely used because I rarely felt like it was the right tool for the job.  But now I feel like there is a tool for every and any kind of blackhead, whitehead, blemish I could get.  I love this kit!!

PROS
' Comes with 5 tools, so 10 different heads you could possibly use for any individual thing that needs popping/squeezing.
' Comes with a great set of directions from the seller - so if you purchase this check your email because the seller sent me the instructions and directions after purchasing it.

CONS:
' Lancet part could be sharper, but then again it's probably good that I'm not able to cut deep with it because I don't want to scar my face while using this.

Brief summary of the helpful descriptions that come (via email) about of the different types of extractors that come in the kit.
Spoon shaped extractor (hole in the middle) its over the blackhead. As gentle pressure is applied to the area, the trapped oil/blackhead pushes out and is released from the skin.
The lancet (needle shaped) end can be used to puncture whiteheads (if it's sharp) - which is good to release the oil/bacteria.
Thin angled curette (looped shape) extractor is used to roll out mature white heads and the flat side to press out blackheads.
Curve angled curette (loop shape) extractor has a unique shape for hard to reach places.
Angled curette extractors come in different shapes and sizes for those delicate areas of the face or body.

Overall I LOVE this kit and am very pleased with the quality of the extractor and how easily they have made it to extract blemishes/blackheads from my skin.

I drink hot coffee and iced tea every day, and I love both savory and sweet foods. I needed a mouth make-over, and the Crest + Oral-B Professional Daily Clean Kit came just at the right time. No excuses now for me not take better care of my teeth and gums--not with this nice reusable tote filled with quality products from top name brands such as Oral-B, Braun, Crest, and Scope. Wow--what a difference this package of products has made in how fresh, clean, and healthy my mouth feels! Several of my friends have tried and recommended electronic toothbrushes, but this is my first experience with a non-manual toothbrush. The Oral-B Healthy Clean Precision 1000 comes with two interchangeable heads, one round regular brush head, and one deep-sweep more rectangular head. When the toothbrush is fully charged, it will run for about a week before needing to be recharged. Both of the brush heads have indicator bristles which will fade half-way when they need to be changed. The toothbrush signals every 30 seconds so that you can move to another section of your mouth. It will stop pulsing if you are brushing too hard. Instead of just vibrating, the toothbrush head oscillates and swivels to move over and around the surface of your teeth and gums. I like to use really minty toothpaste, and the Crest Complete Whitening Toothpaste with Scope offers multiple benefits all in one product. The bottle of Scope Classic Mint Mouthwash adds extra zing and freshness, giving you the confidence of fresh breath. I have tried using dental floss in the past, but it always hurt my gums. The Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Deep Clean Floss is much more pleasant than any floss I have used before, so I am now flossing on a regular basis. The Crest + Oral-B Professional Daily Clean Kit put the smile back on my face, and it's looking better every day. Having all the products together in a bright white reusable tote bag is a nice nudge toward better oral health for yourself, or for someone you care about.",1383350400,0,0,0,0,1

I developed a couple of age spots on my forehead, some areas of redness and whiteheads around my nose, and some fine lines that were definitely new. While I don't mind some natural signs of aging, I don't see why I need to look any older than I have to, so when I was offered a sample of this lactic acid peel to test, I was really excited to try it out. I read in a book on dermatology that this is one of the first, simplest steps people can take to reveal a fresh new layer of skin, and the manufacturer told me that this is the percentage of lactic acid they recommend for beginners.

The manufacturers warn that it can take many peels, even six or seven peels, before you see noticeable results. I have to say that I saw the results much sooner. After about the third peel, I noticed that the area of whiteheads around my nose had reduced significantly. I also noticed that the odd, oily or bumpy texture on my forehead went away entirely. While it did not get rid of my age spots or fine lines, the difference is already dramatic and that I feel like myself again, only a little bit fresher and more revitalized. And, you never know, I am only on peel number six, so I may continue to see increased benefits over time.

Overall, I was really delighted with the results. Though it is always an investment of time and money to try a new technique like this, purchasing an at home peel is a much cheaper first step in visiting the dermatologist, as I can tell you from personal experience. I really feel an enormous boost my self-esteem to have my skin look so much more fresh.",1417910400,0,0,0,0,1

VERY pungent.. if you know what algae and the sea smell like, you will recognize the odor when opened. The mineral content is bound to be good with an odor such as this.

Taste is STRONG. I will not be using this as a flavor enhancer but I am using it to make SOL - a liquid salt mixed with spirulin for a mineral shot.

Medium white grains, good for skin scrubs, soaks, etc.

I saturate them in hibiclens, rinse and then squirt a bit of hydrogen peroxide, rinse thoroughly and allow to dry completely. It's a process and really more than I want to do. That's why these glove are so great!

When you put them on and they stretch out a bit they have tons of tiny pockets/holes and they hold plenty of shower gel or even just lather when you use bar soap (my preference). I start with my face and then work my way down. Super easy and quick and when I'm done, I can just throw them in with some towels and wash. I did hang them over a towel rod to dry because they are for exfoliation and a bit rough so you wouldn't want to wash them with more delicate stuff and even not with your nice towels but it didn't look like they harmed my everyday towels at all.

I felt squeaky clean when done but not raw or anything. They might be a bit much for people with sensitive skin on their faces but they work fabulously for me. I just put on a bit of moisturizer after, let it soak in and it was super easy to put foundation on because there was no dead/dry patches on my face to have to ""fix"".

My husband wouldn't mind having a pair but I don't know if they make them large enough and will be looking into that.

These BIC triple blades, however, worked better than I expected and the ""angle of attack"" for these blades against my skin seemed optimal.  (I often am disappointed by the higher quality -but lower angle- open sided Mach 3 type blades, as those require me to shave at an angle I feel uncomfortable, and the price per use just seems to much for a comparable shave at a lower cost.)

I grew up using double blade Gillette disposables and I feel that these are no less worthy in quality, and I like that the handles are even a little thinner, providing me more control.  (I would happily use either these or the Gillette equivalents, depending on price point.)

I also seem to be able to use these for at least a week before I experience any lack of cutting power, and, after a month of use, and four blades later, I haven't found any cause for concern.

Are these absolutely AMAZING blades? No, of course not, but they didn't frustrate me, and the price point seemed good, so for me they are the perfect (disposable) blades to have around in a pinch.",1528329600,0,0,0,0,1

The rinse comes in an easy to used bottle with a pleasing contour. I did not particuarly care for the wintergreen flavor, it was rather sweet, mint-like and artificial. But my major concern come from the potential side effects for the active ingredient, cetylpridinium chloride. While it has antiseptic, anesthetic and disinfectant properties it is used in bug poisons as well as dental preparations. While its use has been FDA approved, I think there are more natural, less toxic and equally effective ingredients available. Moreover this ingredient has been known to cause browning of the teeth as well as intefering with the sense of taste. The bottle label warns of the discoloration risk but claims that the staining is neither permanent nor harmful. It claims such stains may be removed by brushing or ""at your next dental visit"". If my teeth suddenly browned, I don't think I would want to wait for my next regularly scheduled dental visit. Dental visits don't rate high on my fun things to do list and I would rather not spend my discretionary income on removing tooth discoloration caused by a mouth wash.

So while the performance of this rinse was adequate, I will pass until they change the formulation.",1365206400,0,0,1,0,0

Better than many of the expensive ones. They are more limited in colors, though. It seems that the darker brownish colors of these long wear/24 hour lipsticks last much better than the red/pink tones. It must be something in the formula. The more expensive brands so seem to have colors I like better, but they often wear off too quickly.

Anyway, this Rimmel formula is one of my favorites. It seems to last the longest on me as any brand (except for Makeup Forever and L'oreal...both brownish reds. ) I have this brand in at least 4 colors. I recently dyed my hair bright red (it is semi-permanent, but I love it) and all of my pinkish/mauve lipsticks looked wrong with it. So I had to dig out my reds. I often buy red lipsticks because I love the way reds look on people, and end up hating the ones I have because they look orange-ish. So either they just sit in my makeup drawer or I have to layer them with another color to get the deeper/bluer blood color I need with my skin.

This Play With Fire color is VERY nice. Not an orangy red, but more of a true red. More blue than many many reds I have tried, but not moving into plum or purple. I suppose much of it has to do with your lip and skin color. Mine must be difficult because I have very fair skin and deeper color natural lip (almost a mauve.)

This is the perfect set for those starting out with makeup.  I enjoyed the blue and black bristles that was a nice touch to the usual coloring of brushes but I did notice due to the dark color it was hard to tell how much makeup was on the brush before applying to my face.  Handles are nice and fit my hand well and were easy to use.  Brush bristles did not come out during application nor did they when I cleaned them at the end of the week.  I do not care for the case.  The ties are hard to manage, I prefer a snap closure.  Overall I am satisfied with these brushes.  They have met my needs and applied makeup the way I expected it to.
I gave 4 stars due to the coloring and not knowing how much makeup was on the bristles and because of the case not snapping the way I prefer.
I received a discount for testing and reviewing purposes.  This is my honest unbiased opinion and have come to it by using the makeup brushes myself.",1459123200,0,0,0,1,0

The lotion is wonderful - I love the scent and it moisturizes and softens and smooths my hands (you can read my review).  So I decided to purchase it with the gloves.  This was a mistake.  The gloves cost me about $7.50 more and in my opinion they are worthless.  First of all, the fit.  I have short fingers and I could barely get my thumb into the thumb part.  I don't know how someone with longer fingers would manage.  Then, lint came off in little bits all over my hands, which is not a good feeling.  Last of all, I don't think they do any good.  Instead of helping the lotion to ""absorb"" all they did is wipe the lotion off with their tight fit.  So, please, learn from my mistake and just spend your money on this wonderful lotion.

Pre De Provence Maison French Lavender bath salts come in a plastic 19 ounce container with a screw lid.  There is no protective seal on the product bottle.

Lavender salts are fragrant salts that you pour into your bathwater when the bathtub is filling with water.  They relax you, and help to ease tensions with their floral fragrances.

These bath salts are quite potent.  A little bit goes a long way, as the scent is pungent.

Pamper yourself after a long day by adding these to your bath.  Relax and inhale the beautiful fragrance of lavender.

These also work well when incorporated into sachets.

The only reason I subtracted a star is because I had to give my tub an extra rinse after taking my Lavender incensed bath with these salts.",1504051200,0,0,0,1,0

5304,5,"11 1, 2016",A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX,B00JY8FFDQ,"I received a sample of this product in a subscription box and absolutely loved it.  It's the only product that I bought the full size of.  I have been using this for about 6 months and it works amazingly well.  My skin is sensitive to fragrance and preservatives and this all natural scrub causes no irritation at all.  I use it daily and what I like best about it is that the granules dissolve very easily when I rinse my face with warm water.  I don't have to rub my skin hard, I let the crystals do the work.  I'm in my 50s but am still oily in my T zone but my cheeks occasionally get flaky.  This exfoliant is very gentle and it eliminates the flakiness while keeping my pores clear.  I have had zero blackheads since I started using this scrub every morning.  I use a foaming oil cleanser and mix in some of the crystals and give each section of my face a nice scrub.  My skin is uber sensitive but this scrub has caused no reaction.  I still use St Ives apricot scrub in the shower but it's considerably harder to wash off and the little apricot shells often get caught in my hairline.  Consequently, I've stopped using St Ives unless I'm washing my hair and can be assured that all of the scrub has been washed off.  When I don't wash my hair, I prefer to use the Clarisea crystals because they completely dissolve in water.  I like the fact that they are all natural and don't cause a problem for the environment like the beaded scrubs do (which are outlawed beginning in 2018, thank goodness).  The sea salt crystals completely disintegrate and dissolve in water.  This scrub keeps the flakiness at bay and is also great for my lips.  I use a retinol product at night and using these Clarisea crystals in the morning controls the sloughing skin nicely.  I always have a fresh smooth canvas for makeup when I use the Clarisea scrub.  I have now purchased two full size bottles and will continue to use it.  They last a long time because I only need a very small amount for each application.  They have no noticeable fragrance, which is good for me since I'm sensitive to fragranced cosmetics.  I highly recommend this scrub for all skin types.  It reveals fresh new skin every day and helps keep skin clear.  I don't use the crystals alone but rather in conjunction with a creamy cleanser so the crystals are not harsh.  But if you have troubled skin, you could very well just wet your face with warm water and use the crystals alone.  These crystals are great for clearing blackheads.  My skin looks so much better since I discovered this product.  I definitely recommend them.",1477958400,0,0,0,0,1

This Organic Coco+Nut Oil is made with a light weight blend of cold pressed Coconut Oil, Sweet Almond Oil, Macadamia Nut Oil, Apricot Kernel Oil and Vitamin E.  It delivers instant hydration and is fast absorbing so there is no oily or greasy residue.
Not only is your skin instantly hydrated but it also feels soft and smooth and as added bonus it gives skin a beautiful, healthy glow!  It's pretty fabulous.
The ingredients in this Organic Coco+Nut Oil by Skinfood New Zealand work together to help heal, soothe, repair, nourish, regulate moisture levels and stabilize the natural pH levels in the skin. It really does a little bit of everything and makes skin look and feel amazing!
This oil can also be used anywhere including nails and hair but this one that I would save for your face, neck and decollete.  My favorite way to use this is as a Sleeping Oil.  I apply a generous amount to my face, neck and decollete before bed and in the morning my skin looks revitalized.  Any skin blemishes or irritations are visibly reduced or completely gone.  Dry patches disappear, skin feels hydrated and it even a looks bit younger looking.  LOVE!

I have tried all kinds of inserts. The ones I had liked the most were&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dr-Scholl-s-For-Her-Sole-Expressions-Insole-Women-s-6-10-3-Pair-Package/dp/B0013DAI3C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dr Scholl's For Her Sole Expressions Insole, Women's 6-10, 3-Pair Package</a>. They were economical and cute looking. I preferred the fabric over the gel because the gel ended up causing my feet to get sweaty and they felt slippery. I wasn't completely satisfied with them but they had been the ones I liked the most. I felt I needed more cushion, they helped but at the end of the night my feet still hurt and sometimes they made the shoe fit a little tight so I had to account for that when shoe shopping.

I continued my search and found these.  I read mixed reviews but I decided to try them because the concept was different. Instead of trying ease the pain by providing more cushion to help absorb the weight, they were supposed to redistribute it. After all the cushioned inserts I've tried, I've found that this alone is not the solution.

They are more expensive, for the price I could get almost twice as many dr. scholls but I have to say that they have been worth it. I wear a 6.5-7 and I got that size. The shape resembles the outer shape of a small spoon with a fat handle and made of a flexible polyurethane plastic.  I would have preferred that they be covered in a fabric because they make for less slip and sweating but at least its not on the ball of the foot where there is more shifting and could potentially cause blisters.

The thing is that they are tricky to place, they have to be placed just so in order for them to be effective so read the directions! They are placed with the bowl part of the ""spoon"" at the heel. About half an inch down it starts to get a little thicker and continues all the way down to the handle, which is what they refer to as ""the bump"".

You start by removing a small part of the plastic liner and placing the bowl about 3mm (1/8in) away from the end of your shoe at the heel part and keep shifting them up or down until they sit just right.  Then you remove the liner and permanently adhere.

If you pull your leg up and take a sideways look at it, you have the ball of your foot that then arches up, at the other end you have your heel that also begins to arch up and they meet in the middle.  The idea is to get that bump right underneath where your HEEL starts to arch up (the calcaneus).  Thats where you want it.  I can't insert any links but google Insolia, fitting tips from the product engineer and you can read more about it there, they do a much better job of explaining, with pictures and everything.

I tried them on a 4inch pair of pumps that had very little cushion and they worked great. They didn't feel like the most comfortable shoes in the world and they mention that it doesn't aim to add comfort. Instead of starting out with a comfort level of 8 and, after all that strain of carrying all your weight on the balls of your feet, 4 hours later you end up with a comfort level of 2, you start out with a comfort level of lets say 5 and end up with a comfort level of 4-5 at the end of the night. It works, I came home after 4 hours, a lot of walking and standing, and my feet hurt a little but they were not throbbing with the pain I usually have even with really cushioned heels.

Since they don't cover the entire length of the shoe, I am going to try adding some cushions to the ball of my foot and see if that works better.  I am also going to experiment with adding the Dr. Scholls sole expressions over them to see if that helps any. That might add to much height and make my shoe slip off but I won't know for sure until I try. But I am definitely buying more of these for the rest of my ridiculously high shoes.

My only real gripe was getting that plastic liner off, I don't know if they are all like that or if I got a defective pair. OMG, it took me like 25min to remove separate those liners. I broke two nails and almost threw them away in frustration.  You would think that company who thought of this brilliant idea would add a little tab or something to help with that.",1356912000,0,0,0,0,1

I have been pleasantly surprised by this curling wand, finding that its efficiency is actually really close to my professional grade hot tools.
The crystals in the wands shaft are a cute addition to the stylish pink handle, and they sparkle under most light sources.
The wand is surprisingly light also, but then again I'm used to heavy gold wands...it's a nice change to feel such a light, easily maneuverable tool.
I cannot say exactly how long it took to warm up, but I was out of the room for about 5 minutes and it was very ready to use when I returned.
The LED showing that it's on is a neat addition too, as I hate trying to read the tiny 'on/off' wording next to most tools switches.

Overall, I've been really impressed with its performance. It curls hair quickly and well. I need to look into its sanitation requirements before taking it in to the salon, but I will definitely be keeping it for personal use either way, because it's such an efficient tool. (Take a second to watch my video to see it's speed in action.)

So, this lotion has been a Godsend for my dry patches of skin; it has been making a huge difference. Not only does it help get rid of that ashy look but it helps to make my skin feel really smooth. It feels like a very luxurious lotion.

I like the consistency of this lotion. Its not super thick but not all watery either. I do use a generous amount because I found that a little just isn't enough and I would have to use more. The lotion absorbs after just a few minutes and doesnt leave my skin feeling sticky or greasy.

I love the size of the bottle. At first, I couldn't figure out how to open it but then it clicked ""literally"" lol. It opens from the bottom and you can easily squeeze out the desired amount. I prefer this method because it helps to keep the product where you need it (near the opening).

I wish I could describe the scent, but I cant. Youll just have to take my word for it: youll love it! I have a sensitive nose and even though its on the powerful side, it doesnt bother me at all. This is a winner and the ""good for you"" ingredients really make it all the more worth it. No one wants to put harmful poisons on their skin! :)

This is the perfect soap for someone like me, who isn't a morning person, to have in the shower. It makes me feel good and puts a smile on my face - even early in the morning. It makes me want to linger in the shower just to experience that fragrance. It's a good thing that it's shea butter enriched. It keeps my skin from feeling dry, even it a hot shower.

It has been a year and I have noticed a puddle of water around the Waterpik after I turn it off. I think the handle is now leaking.
After my braces come off I will probably throw the Waterpik away.

5587,5,"02 14, 2015",AEC90GPFKLAAW,B00Q794RMA,"I've never used magnesium in a spray before I received this complimentary sample of Seven Minerals Magnesium oil (for review purposes). Lack of magnesium can cause muscle cramps and heart palpitations, menstrual cramps, restless legs and constipation (Milk of Magnesia is an anti-constipation medicine). It's most common in people who do a lot of sports or sweat a lot from working outdoors, but as much as 80% of people are low in magnesium. Magnesium is found naturally in green leafy vegetables, cashew nuts and pumpkin seeds, and some legumes like black beans, but many people don't eat enough of these foods to get sufficient magnesium.

Magnesium ""oil"", which is not really an oil (it's magnesium chloride), is found in brine harvested from ancient sea beds, and can be absorbed through the skin. It's more easily absorbed by our bodies this way than through taking an oral supplement. I've used Seven Minerals Magnesium oil for about a week now, and as with many vitamin and mineral supplements it's hard to say it's definitely working. I spray it on my feet and let it dry before I go to bed. I don't notice the itching some reviews have noted, but I have noticed that my restless/twitchy legs have been better since I started using it. The aloe vera added to this product soothes the skin and helps counteract the salt, although I also use a moisturizer on my feet after the spray has dried.

I believe this is a convenient and effective way to add magnesium to your body, and people with more severe cramping issues could find some relief from it. Because my diet is pretty balanced already, I didn't see huge benefits but I do feel it helped with my restless legs at night.",1423872000,0,0,0,0,1

They are easy to wash out (I wash them with soap and water after each use) and they are always dry by the next morning when I use use them again.  They haven't bled much color.  Although I did let them soak in rubbing alcohol after I got them to make them bleed as much as they could, but now when I use them and wash them after they don't bleed pink or purple very much if at all.  Overall I'm very pleased with these sponges, especially to get 2 this size for $6.99 (the price at the time I am posting this) - is a great price.  Very pleased.

I love how my skin feels after the mask. Both products are orangy in color and the mask has a pleasant smell. Even though it is orange it quickly absorbs and dry with no tight feeling, or, at least, I didn't experience. The instructions state to leave on for 15-30 minutes of which I did the full 30 minutes. I have used some masks that dry and crack and scare small children and pets, but with this hydration mask, you don't have that. You can go about your business, well at home anyway, then rinse off after the allotted time. The skin on my face felt nice and smooth and soft.

The True Glow Eye Cream I applied every night after cleansing, it absorbs quickly. I am 62 so the use of products that aid in the aging process is important to me. The use of organic and natural ingredients is extremely important also. You spend a lifetime being exposed to chemicals and other toxic things just in the air you breathe. I want a good quality product that assists me in what I need in an anti-aging product. I really like both of these products.

But the star of the kit, the best thing about it for sure, is the enclosed clock and brushing ""meter"".  What it does is keeps track of how long you brush, giving you four stars for 30 seconds on each mouth quadrant.  You can also get a fifth star (for tongue) if you go a total of 2 1/2 minutes.  For me, that's not a big deal.  But for my six year old, the stars have been a boon to getting him to brush more thoroughly.

He brushes with enthusiasm now, and I've noticed his teeth looking much cleaner than with just a brush alone.  For me, it's a helpful reminder to brush longer than I was used to.  The whole set is convenient, with a countertop charger and no batteries being required.  And having a clock in the bathroom was new to me, and very convenient.

However, two things keep me from giving it five stars.  One, the price point.  I wouldn't pay more than $50 for this set.  In all actuality, it doesn't seem worth the extremely high price point.  I mean, a Crest tote bag?  What am I going to do with that?  I don't think the set warrants the price.

The other minor point about this is you have to brush with your mouth tightly closed or you get watery toothpaste sprayed all over the mirror and counter.  Not to mention your face!  My son has to brush before he dresses or his school shirts get ruined.  So, it's a minor thing to get used to, but sort of annoying.

It takes about 5 seconds to pull the plastic tab off the top and then unscrew the applicator to rip off the foil underneath.  I'm not really sure what the purpose of the applicator is; it's not really touch-free because the ointment comes out in a glob and you pretty much have to use your hands to rub it in, or at least ""try"" to rub it in.

I even did a test; on one hand I put petroleum jelly and on the other this Aquaphor and I couldn't really tell any difference in the feel or greasiness.

After putting a small glob of this on my hands (which get very dry here in the desert), I rub lotion on top so my hands don't feel as greasy and so I could actually use my hands without leaving grease marks everywhere (like on the tube itself).

Not quite sure how many women that have been attracted to me because of Aqua Velva,  I do know for sure that it's just to many to count. Ha.  Not sure how long this has been around but the Williams Company ran a paper advertisement, taken from a 1949 magazine, which features Ralph Bellamy of Detective Story and Ezio Pinza of South Pacific for Aqua Velva After Shave Lotion. I'm sure you all remember Ralph Bellamy and Ezio Pinza from the 40's right.

There slogan was "" There is nothing like an AQUA VELVA MAN "" and it seemed to work because this was a hot item when I was a young man. It's just amazing that this is still around when the vast majority of after shave lotions from that time period have disappeared over the years.

The only negative about Aqua Velva is it does not last very long. Usually in less than an hour the aroma has dissipated. The more expensive after shave lotions and perfumes have Ambergris in them which is quite expensive and comes from a sperm whale this enables the aroma to linger much longer.

At any rate this is a great classic after shave with a wonderful refreshing odor, give it a try you might just like it.

Exhibit A, for example, is a bright clownish looking orange-red that surely has scared off many a gal. But for those who know how to use a blush brush properly (ie, high quality bristles, good construction, a judicious amount of pressure, good blending), these babies pay off. And I mean pay off not just in beautiful color, but in how long they last, because this quality and pigmentation means you don't need to use a lot. One of these can last you a long, long time, even with daily use.

I have Exhibit A, Torrid, Taos, Crazed, Luster, and Mata Hari, which covers a range of warm and cool tones. Exhibit A is my fave go to red blush. Using just a touch of my duo-fibre MAC brush on it (ie MAC 187 brush), this deposits a beautiful, face-brightening blush to the cheeks. Too much and you look like Bozo, so this does require restraint.

Mata Hari is a lovely, feminine, cool pink-rose tone that I, who have olive skin, can wear and look like I was out walking briskly. Those two are my fave ones from NARS as they are matte. The others have some shimmer and require even more care in application and go well with a shiny gloss on the lips.

Luster is more like a highlighting color for me (it's a goldeny-lustrous color on me). It's pretty much the color of my skin with shimmer, so I can put it on without a color payoff, but it gives a nice glow that I like for days when I look ""tired"". A perking up thing. Also nice for adding glow when going out at night/to a party. On a lighter person, it's probably a nice warmth on the cheeks, sort of like a subtle bronzer. Could probably highlight eyes, all over, too. It's versatile.

Crazed is a deep raspberry pink with shimmer (ie, a cooler color that has glowiness). Taos is like a somewhat warm deep rosed-up red. It's a color that will definitely suit darker tones, but can be used by fairer women with much restraint. Torrid is a gorgeous deep peachy sort of tone with shimmer. I'm wearing it today with Manhunt by NARS (lipstick) overlaid with Red Devil coral-red gloss by MAC. Torrid is not as deeply-intense as Crazed or Taos, but it's not a shy color either. Will give a nice payoff.

I'm med-dark olive toned (NC44 in MAC) and all those look fine on me. I'm ordering Gilda to add to the peachy colors in my blush collection (which right now includes two MAC peachy tones and one by Physician's Formula). With summer coming in, I'm looking for peachier/warmer tones.

These are expensive-ish, but these are top-notch, and it's no wonder makeup artists and celebrities love NARS blushes. (Note: I don't own the much-touted, much-beloved, nearly legendary Orgasm, though, which is more suited to ligther-than-me gals, but it really is pretty in the pan. I have heard good things about Super Orgasm colorwise, if you don't mind having chunks of glitter fall off your brush.)

UPDATE: I got my Gilda blush and it's lovely. A soft-textured, nicely-pigmented matte peach that will look fabulous with peachy-coral and more orangey glosses for Spring and summer, or even with nude glosses.",1237939200,0,0,0,0,1

Until recently, I've had no preference to any brand, as I felt they were all pretty similar.  After seeing some of the awards that Pattern Body Wash has received in various men's magazines I decided to try it for myself.

On opening the bottle, the fragrance was not overpowering or chemical-smelling, at all;  in fact, it was quite the opposite,  It has a great aroma with, not really a subtle scent, rather more subdued, and certainly not overwhelming.  In addition to nutmeg, I have also tried citrus, eucalyptus, cucumber, sage and black pepper, and all of them have been outstanding fragrances.  I was also impressed by the small amount of gel needed to clean the entire body.  Many of the other brands that I have tried seem to over-foam and usually leave a little residue that needs a secondary rinse to remove.  This is not the case with any of the Pattern products I have tried.  The body wash is silky, with just the right amount of lather, and it cleans exceptionally well.

One of the other areas, in which I compare body washes, is the dryness that ensues after toweling off after a shower.  Pattern is exceptional in this realm and leaves the skin smooth and soft, even in a very dry climate with little humidity.

The price point is certainly several dollars more than I would normally spend on a standard body wash, but in all truth, one bottle lasts longer than all of the other companies I have tried over the past 20 years.

Therefore, one should use a Crest Strip product such as the entry-level system&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Classic-Whitestrips-Crest-Dental-Whitening-System-56-Strips/dp/B000FBWFTI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Classic Whitestrips-Crest Dental Whitening System, 56 Strips</a>, or a stronger product like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crest-Whitestrips-Premium-7-Day-Dental-Whitening-Formula-System-28-Strips/dp/B000FVU2DY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crest Whitestrips Premium- 7- Day Dental Whitening Formula System, 28 Strips</a>, before the Daily Multicare Formula is used.

This product is used for just 5 minutes a day to maintain the whiteness of bleached teeth. (All the other Crest Whitestrip products advise a 30-minute treatment once or twice a day protocol). Since there are 84 strips (42 upper/42 lower), this enough for a full 6 weeks of daily bleaching.
There are virtually no side-effects, such as sensitive teeth, or ""burned"" gums, as the contact time is just 5 minutes. This system has a 6% hydrogen peroxide gel, the same as Crest Classic Whitestrips.

An alternative to this product of daily bleaching maintenance is to use one of the original systems again, such as Classic Whitestrips for 1-2  weeks to restore the bleach white color of the teeth.

Crest White Strips come in as many as 7 different formulations, which can be quite confusing to the consumer.  Please remember the key difference in all these products is the strength of the hydrogen peroxide gel, and of course the price. The higher the dose of hydrogen peroxide, the faster the bleaching result, and the most costly as well.  Here is a quick summary of the products:

1. Crest White Strips Classic.  This is Crest's first bleaching product, introduced in 2001.  It has a 6% hydrogen peroxide gel, and is applied twice a day for 30 minutes for 14-days of treatment.  It is still a very popular product, and perhaps offers the lowest number of side-effects.

2. Crest White Strips Premium came out in 2004.  It is a 10% hydrogen peroxide gel, applied twice a day for 30 minutes each session, for 7-days of treatment. The 10% hydrogen peroxide strength offers a quicker bleaching result, but perhaps with more tooth and gum sensitivity.

3.  Crest Pro Effects came out in 2008. It is another 10% hydrogen peroxide gel, but offers a 10-day treatment protocol - again, twice a day for 30 minutes each time.

4. Crest Advanced Seal is the latest product (February, 2009), and it also has a 10% hydrogen peroxide, twice a day, 30-minutes a day, 10-day treatment. The main advantage to this system is that the strip is more adherent to the teeth, and the user can talk, exercise, drive, be active, even drink fluids, with the strip in place.  The other systems advise the user to be stationary for the 30-minute treatment time.

5. Daily Whitening with Tartar Protection is another 6% hydrogen peroxide gel strip. It is used just 5-minutes/day, and has an added chemical that discourages tartar from attaching to the teeth.  It has 38 upper and lower strips in the package.  Some people form tartar very easily, especially on the backs of the lower teeth, and this product inhibits the tartar from attaching to the teeth.

In using any of the Crest bleaching products, please follow the specified instructions that come with each product.

Crest White Strip products work for the vast majority of people. Younger people with yellow stains seem to respond better than older people or those with gray stains. If you have severely stained teeth, especially those with tetracycline (an antibiotic) stain, the strips may not work well for you.

If you are not satisfied with the results and still want whiter teeth, you can then see your dentist for a more concentrated in-office form of bleaching (called ""power bleaching"").

They are made with vegetable oil only, no animal fat, and are quadruple-milled to last a long time.  They contain glycerin and shea butter as moisturizers, so that they don't dry out the skin as much as some soaps do.

The variety of fragrances is impressive, and they all smell so nice that its hard to decide on a favorite.  Agrumes (citrus) smells distinctly of grapefruit with lemony notes and the verbena smells as fresh as if you had just plucked a leaf from the bush and crushed it in your hand.  The almond, pomegranate, and mirabelle (plum) will make your mouth water.  The florals such as violette and angels trumpet are a pleasant change from  offensive artificial floral scents.  The milk, coconut, and green tea are more subdued fragrances and are a good choice for people who don't like strong fragrances.

Nothing in the description indicated that the mask would come with only a Korean power system, requiring me to purchase a transformer at an additional cost of $40.  I contacted the seller, to no avail.  The transformer converts 220-240 volts down to 110-120 Volts so I was able to try the mask.  The problem is that the transformer is gigantic and smells of gas every time you use it, so it kind of made me feel nauseous.  I checked the listing again carefully to see if it was my error, but it was not.  They simply did not disclose that you could not use the mask without a transformer.  That said, I previously purchased a LED light mask from Project E Beauty, and if was 1/4 of the price, and frankly does the exact same thing.  I was hoping that this mask was going to provide a higher quality, more akin to the LED light you get at the dermatology office, but it did not.  So, in my opinion, don't waste your money and buy one of the other less expensive ones made in the US.  I sent this back to the company.  Very disappointed.",1500681600,1,0,0,0,0

Endless summers spent swimming and waterskiing with little more than a slathering of cocoa butter on my face has left me with LOTS of sun damage and age spots.  I have used several dark spot correctors over the years and the one made by Clinique has managed to fade them, up to a point.  I also exfoliate regularly and use a mild facial peel weekly.  Sadly, even after all that my skin still looks dull and uneven.

This Illuminating serum somehow makes my skin look brighter, as in glowing, even after just one use.  It must have some kind of reflecting particles in it to diffuse light or something, or else how can it work so fast?  I don't know, but the brightening effect gets better with consistent use.  I can tell a difference when I'm in a hurry and don't put it on because my skin looks dull and lifeless.

There is a selection of four brush heads included, and I like the spinning head the best.  I have been using an Oral-B 1000 model for a few weeks so can compare it to this high-end 5000 model.

The charging base is nice, with no wall wart or metal contacts. At least when new, the battery will last for more than week of twice- or thrice-daily brushings. There are several brushing modes, including one for sensitive teeth and a mode with longer brushing times.  The sensitive mode is noticeably gentler.

This model will alert when a 30 or 45 second brushing time per quadrant has finished, by pulsing and with the little radio timer.  I don't really like the timer feature but it would be very helpful to teach a child how to brush; the visual reinforcement is effective.

The brush tips change easily but don't come off under use and they have colored rings to identify brush heads for multiple users. The handle is just the right size and has soft-touch plastic so it is comfortable and easy to grip. It really is waterproof because I have been using it in the shower with no problems. I would hesitate to actually immerse the bottom of the handle, though.

It is necessary to use a soft touch with these brushes; it is not pressure but the movement of the bristles that disturbs the plaque. Be especially careful if you have gum recession or crowns.  Fortunately, this model warns about using too much pressure.  I find this helpful.

There is an accessory that fits over the charging base to hold extra toothbrush heads which some may find useful as well as a carrying case.  I probably wouldn't bother with the weight and bulk when traveling and will continue to carry a manual toothbrush.

No complaints at all with this toothbrush except that the handle shows water and toothpaste residue and the heads are rather costly compared to a manual toothbrush. I do think it's worth the expense, though, for the ease in brushing, although the less-expensive models have the same basic features. An electric toothbrush would be especially helpful for anyone with arthritis in the hands.",1386115200,0,0,0,0,1

My daughter has really gotten into wearing different hair bows in her hair when she goes to school.  Sometimes my husband does her hair in the morning when i'm not there and lets face it, he isn't the best when it comes to that.  These hair bows are so cute and you get so different colors that have white polka dots on them.  They are easy to put in the hair, so easy that my husband has no issues with these.

You get 8 bows and each one is a different color with white polka dots.  They are a ribbon material and the colors are very vibrant and pretty.  They have the alligator clips on the bows, so you don't have to mess with clasps or anything(those other clasps are hard for my husband to deal with, he loves the alligator clips).

You can put the hair up in a ponytail, braid or up-do and just clip this in.  They don't fall out of the hair, and my daughter being a 6 year old that loves to play comes home with these still clipped in her hair.  I completely recommend it and think they are really cute in my daughter's hair.

I don't have any permanent tattoos and the thought of a temporary one in metallic gold & silver is a cool idea.  I purchased a sheet which contains 7 strips of gold & silver metallic patterns.  So one afternoon when I was looking after my niece we had a play with them.  They come on one sheet and have a protected film over them, so make sure you remove this before you apply to your skin, and yes I made the mistake of doing this - doh!  Here's the instructions for application:

1. Clean and dry the skin completely
2. Cut out the design of your choice and remove the protected film
3. Place the tattoo pattern side down on to your skin
4. Rub and wet the paper side of the tattoo completely with damp cloth or sponge
5. Peel the corner of the Tattoo gently to check if it has transferred. If not, press down and wet again.
6. Your Tattoo can last for a few days if transferred carefully.
7. How to remove the Tattoo - wash with soap and water or baby oil will remove the Tattoo instantly.

Great for a night out or dressing up.  I love the fact that they are not permanent, there are tons of other designs so you can wear them to suit your mood.  Lots of fun, pretty and cheap to buy.",1463616000,0,0,0,0,1

It has a firm consistency and softens from the warmth of the skin.  It is a bit oily but gets absorbed quickly.  It smells so good!  This one contains sandalwood and geranium essential oils, and, of course, there is a wonderful beeswax scent.  I am currently suffering from eye eczema as a result of sun exposure.  My eyes feel raw after washing my face, and even my trusted high end creams are extremely irritating to my eyes.  Fysio creams are the most soothing ones out of all products that I tried, including those that are specifically targeted to eczema sufferers.

But this product is amazing, it leaves my skin so soft and so touchable, I can't believe it, I just want to touch my face. It came with samples of their other creams, and they are also amazing and leave my face so soft... the day and night cream I believe doesn't have any shark collagen in it, so I may buy that, I got a sample of that and it was really nice. I love this product, despite myself. It's really great. Give it about 30 minutes to fully absorb before applying other facial products, and then continue with your facial routine.

However, the major selling point for this kit is the Oral-B toothbrush, and it is a knock-out -- particularly with the back and forth cleaning head. I have used numerous automatic toothbrushes with the circular action, but this lateral movement really makes me feel like I get deep clean.

I have a dental bar behind my bottom center back teeth to keep the, straight -- it is really a permanent retainer. I have these little floss loops that thread floss through for me to clean, but I don't use them all the time and try to hit the area good with my multiple times a day brushing. This head's scrubbing action coupled with its speed make it a killer option for cleaning that area. I love it for reaching back there and keeping me tidy and build-up free in-between flossing.

The unit seems to keep a charge really well. I use it almost every day (I still use a manual brush at times) and have used it for at least 10 days this last time without it needing plugged in -- a definite plus.

The first feature that I noticed is that is quite runny; it actually looks like milk when you dispense it onto your fingers and you have to work quickly to apply it to your face before it drips off. The scent is hard to describe - not perfumed, but slightly raw smelling, like a bowl of chopped fresh vegetables. The description on the plastic bottle says ""...made with Certified Raw (tm) Complex combining the science of classic ingredients blended with nature's therapeutics including Tamanu, Monoi, Hibiscus extracts and Vitamins."" Apparently the ingredients are never heated above 115 degrees because enzymes die at higher temperatures.

A list of the ingredients is not printed on the bottle, primarily because it is a really long list - approximately 34 with water being the first listed. The natural claims don't quite mesh with the long list of ingredients, such as tetrasodium glutamate diacetate and potassium hydroxide. I assume these are the ""classic ingredients"". There are also plant based ingredients including sesame seed oil, coconut oil, and gardenia flower extract, among others.

Unfortunately, the lotion does not offer sufficient moisturization for my very dry skin, so I have to apply a small amount of another cream on top of it. It would be probably be sufficient alone if you had less dry skin.",1460592000,0,1,0,0,0

Mix water and peppermint oil and use these bottles to spritz windows and baseboards to keep spiders and bugs at bay.  These bottles would be great for DIY cleaning solutions, too, because they are small and easy to hold.

I recently got a bottle of shimmer body oil, but it came in a flip-top dispenser that made it difficult for me to use.  With a spray bottle, I can get a even, light layer of the oil all over my body - even in areas that are harder for me to reach.  And, this way, I don't get clumps of glitter in any one spot - the spray mist is fine enough to dispense just a little of the shimmer for a flattering glow.

5702,5,"05 20, 2015",A6P370Q9YB27F,B00UT0AFFG,"We have all seen the commercials for the product that increases eyelash growth and it's something that we all want and/or need. Well, more like want! I'm not going to see my doctor to discuss my healthy lashes and then pay for a prescribed product. That is just not happening here! I can see though, like purchasing a mascara doing the same when it comes to using a serum. I buy serums for my skin, so why not buy something for my lashes too?

VIDI is a skincare company that offers an eyelash/eyebrow serum as part of their beauty line. This is my first time working with VIDI and they were kind enough to send me the product to give it a 4-week try.

IncreduLASH is a product that nourishes your own natural eyelashes and promotes growth, plus it comes with 0% of the risks and side effects, which are associated with other products on the market, including the prescribed brands. Permanent darkening of my eye's skin is not something I am willing to risk when the dark circles look is not my cup of tea! It's a serum that can be applied to encourage growth to your eyebrows in case you plucked one too many in your lifetime or with age, we tend to start getting growth that is no longer fuller or longer in length. I'm so far so good when it comes to my lashes and thankfully I was blessed with both eyebrows that are as full as my lashes. I just wanted to enhance the look and also test how effective and how quick it worked. It took me 3 months to get Coconut oil to show it's effects on my eyebrows when I read they need to be moisturized too. Eyebrow gels, cosmetics, and anything you use to temporarily darken or make your eyebrows look fuller and thicker......well, they tend to stress them out too. Yup, that means you get thinning and just loss of hairs and lashes, which then means you need more cosmetics to get the look you want that is being compromised by the product(s) you use (the never ending cycle).  I use a clear eyebrow gel and I noticed that my skin, plus the hairs get dehydrated over time. I then started to apply oils to my eyebrows but this is only something I can do at night, as oily eyebrows is not something I have heard is the ""gotta have it"" look at the moment :).

Application:
Simple to apply and like anything you use in that area, just watch it when it comes to getting it in your eye. Hey, even Coconut oil hurts when it starts travelling into my eye! You simply take the wand and brush along the eye's skin where your lashes start (the root, per say). One continuous stroke on each eye and done. You also apply the serum after freshly washing your face because the surface must be clean and free of anything else, like with most serums should be applied to any skin area (i.e. thinner product in texture gets applied first). You only use it once a day too, so it really is easy to work into any beauty regimen. For eyebrow use, the same application principle as your eyes applies and make sure the product dries and absorbs before applying anything else.

Verdict:
I added IncreduLASH to my nightly beauty routine and used it only once a day on my lashes. I use the product as a ""spot corrector"" on one eyebrow because I had an ""oops"" while plucking and created a spot that was missing 2 to 3 hairs. Yes, my spot would eventually yield hairs again but I'm a girl that has little patience when it comes to my boo-boos being corrected. The serum by VIDI states most start seeing results within 2 weeks. I can say by 2.5 weeks, my lashes felt and looked nicer. I had zero stragglers like when you have those mini lashes that began to grow and they are too short to notice before you apply mascara, but then obstruct your vision once you do! Those mini lashes drive me crazy and I then have to use the mascara wand's tip to make them stick to a lash-buddy that is of normal length......I have also plucked them when they don't play nice. Yes, it starts the process of growing again but I then hope the new lash heard the screams of the last lash being plucked and will behave :). It was nice not having to deal with shorties, so that was a definite positive that I saw from IncreduLASH's results. I also found the texture of the hairs were enhanced I lost less when I curled my lashes and/or washed the mascara off. Sometimes I even lost none! Next, the spot on my eyebrow. What spot? By week three the spot was a thing of the pass and from my experience, it would take me a month and a half to see those mistakes show any hairs that are long enough and I did not need to blot some eyebrow pencil to cover it up. IncreduLASH does work and because you use so little product upon application, it makes the investment sting less when it comes to sticker price. I use less mascara and like this natural fuller lash look that did not need a doctor's visit to get. I'm a DIY gal and especially when it comes to beauty solutions and IncreduLASH is a soultion that works, plus VIDI guarantees it! I received the above product(s) free of charge from VIDI (IncreduLASH).  I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.

2616,4,"11 27, 2007",A23GFTVIETX7DS,B000V5Z4J6,"The Sonicare UV Sanitizer uses a small but strong light bulb inside a chrome-painted plastic housing to kill electric toothbrush bacteria on a daily basis.  All one needs to do is shake the water from the brush head, insert it into the capsule, close the door, and push a button.  Ten minutes later, when the small green light stops blinking, the brush head is free of at least 90% of bacteria. (Don't think about the other ten percent!)  Does it work?  Since I'm not a microbiologist, I can't say for sure, but all the warnings that come with the box suggest that the light is powerful enough to do the necessary damage.

The Sanitizer comes with adaptors that accommodate brush heads of multiple brands of electric toothbrushes:  Sonicare, Oral B, and Braun.  Not only do the adaptors address difference in bottom connectors (round or rectangular), but they also adjust for differences in height to keep the bristles at the right level.  Users can insert the larger Sonicare brush assembly or a much smaller Oral B brush or both at the same time.  (See product picture for illustration.)  Since I use an electric toothbrush only once a day and use a traditional brush at other times, I wish that the housing could fit regular brushes as well.  That feature might make this product nearly perfect.

Unfortunately, the unit sterilizes only the brush heads and not the entire brush.  This means that the interior needs to be cleaned at least once a week, if not more often, because of the saliva-and-water mix that drains from inside the brush and down its sides.  The bottom tray and adaptors snap out fairly easily for cleaning; however, it would be nice if the entire interior compartment emerged germ-free.

Although the sanitizer comes with strict warnings about not touching the bulb, making it not appropriate for use in the bathrooms of young children, it does have the safety feature of shutting off if the door is opened during operation. The canceled operation won't cool the bulb, but it will stop the UV radiation.  The plastic bulb housing seems to protect the bulb adequately from all but the tiniest fingers.  (I'm not even sure toddler fingers could get in, although kids have been known to defeat a host of safety devices.)

The unit is lightweight and compact enough to pack on a trip for those who travel with their electric toothbrushes and who don't like the idea of invisible germs lurking in their bristles, even for a few days.  All you'll need is a standard outlet and a small flat surface to set it up.

I like the Sonicare UV Santizer for its easy of use.  Maybe it's giving me a false sense of security since I can't tell whether it works or not, but ignorance can indeed be bliss.",1196121600,0,0,0,1,0

The Pre De Provence lavender spray smells fabulous. Not the least bit musty, which some lavender sprays can get a bit of a musty undertone, not this one. It's fresh and clean and brightens the entire room. I iron clothes inside out if I'm going to use any spray, and a light spritz left a wonderful fragrance, not overwhelming, and didn't stain my clothes. I would suggest trying a small out of the way place first.

The spray is also good for just refreshing laundry. Getting out winter clothes from storage that are perfectly clean but could just a use a little pick me up after storage.

My eyes are itchy and have dark reddish circles underneath, which prompt questions from those who have not seen me for awhile, what happened to my eyes. There have been some assumptions that I have been beaten and do not want to admit that. Needless to say, I am quite eager to lose the look that I am sporting right now, and am obsessed with eye serums and eye creams that can help me with that. So, among others I tried SoonPure Concentrated Hyaluronic Acid Eye Serum.

It arrived promptly and was properly sealed. The box features abundant hieroglyphs writings which I hoped were in Korean, as I highly respect Korean beauty products, but most likely they are in Chinese. I tried to find that out by visiting the website that is listed on the box, however, I found it to be nonexistent. Some lines are poorly translated to English: ""Supplementary eye water and nutrients "", ""Improve the black eye to improve the eye fine lines"", ""Improve eye week"". There is no translation of the ingredient list, however, PEG-40 is in English, and it is my understanding that it is not a desired ingredient for the skin care products. There are some Latin names: Avena sativa, Tremella foci forms, and Butyrospermum parkii, the latter I believe is Shea butter.

The serum comes in a clear 10 ml bottle. An eye dropper was enclosed in the package and needs to be inserted in the bottle. The liquid itself is clear and colorless. It is very runny, but slightly more viscous than water. I was happy that it did not irritate the skin under my eyes which is extremely sensitive right now. I feel that a separate moisturizer is needed to be applied on top to keep the eye area from drying. The serum did not leave a sticky or greasy residue which is a plus. I just started using it a few days ago, so I cannot report any reduction in eye circles. I will update later, if with continued use I see a noticeable difference. I do not currently have any puffiness under my eyes. The serum did not clogged the pores or caused any breakouts. With addition of moisturizer it will probably help with the reduction of fine lines, or at least prevent the formation of the new ones.

This shaver is best if you shave on a daily basis. It contours to your face and neck and gives an even shave all over. However, if you like to go 2-3 days between a shave it will have trouble giving you a close shave. Your trusty Mach III will be better equipped to handle that growth.

The ergonomics of this shaver are wonderful, it is small and light and very easy to hold and maneuver around your face. It comes with it's own tiny case and charges by induction in that case which also protects it for travel. However, this shaver does not do a significantly different job compared to the sub $100 shavers made by Norelco. It is easier to shave the more difficult portions like the neck with it as the heads ""flex and pivot"" to conform to your shape. But again, the difference is very minor compared to the older shavers.

Instead of trying to work on a lather, a foaming soap is already made up of soap suds.  Foaming liquid soap is generally thinner and watery, or else it will clog the mechanism to produce suds.  You can buy refills in bigger containers.  Or better, some people are successful in mixing water and other liquid soap.

Tone is made by Dial. Dial also makes a line of foaming soap but Tone is known more for their cocoa butter soap products.  A 7.5 oz bottle lasts a long time.  It is gentle to the hands and has a nice refreshing smell.  More convenient than a regular soap for your powder room and sinks.  Generally one pump is enough to cover both hands.  Just make sure that you cup your hands or the soap will spurt across the room.  One wrong pump is all that it takes to learn how to use a foaming soap dispenser.",1219968000,0,0,0,1,0

It does have gritty particles in it, so those who wash themselves with the bar of soap rather than using a wash cloth or some such item might find it slightly rough.

I was curious, since the package does not list ingredients what these gritty particles were. I found on the Dove site the following list: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate or Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine or Sodium C14-C16 Olefin Sulfonate, Sodium Cocoate or Sodium Palm Kernelate, Fragrance, Microcrystalline Wax, Sodium Chloride, Propylene Glycol, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Green 5, Iron Oxides, Red 30 Lake, Titanium Dioxide, Yellow 5 Lake, Yellow 6.

It seems the gritty particles are microcrystalline wax. Don't let the steric acid scare you - it' a fatty acid occurring naturally in plants and it's the ingredient that lets shaving creams, cosmetics and skin cleansers work...it just doesn't sound good to have in something you are putting on your skin. Maybe that's why the list of ingredients isn't on the soaps.

In total this is a nice bar of soap, it works, but I noticed that after using it twice; its size had shrunk to way less than the irish spring that had been used several more times than this. That makes me question its value.",1364688000,0,0,0,1,0

My family uses it to induce sweating on the skin to loosen phlegm and cut the length of sickness down much faster. When you get rid of the phlegm your body gets over the sickness faster. It is a very helpful oil for menstrual pain as well.

I like the packaging of this product. It is clean, simple, and to the point. I love that it comes in a bottle with a pump; very hygienic and easy to use! A pump was enough serum to cover my whole face and some of my neck, which means that this bottle will last me a long time. The serum itself has a light and pleasant scent. The scent wasn't noticeable once I applied the product to my face. The serum went smoothly onto my face. As it was absorbing into my skin, my face felt sticky. That went away completely in a couple of minutes and I was left with very soft skin. I use this product in the morning under my makeup, and it does help to make my face brighter and look more awake in the morning! I have noticed that with regular use of this serum, my skin is brighter and my fine lines are diminishing, which is amazing!

Vitamin C serums can be used for more than just the face. Vitamin C is great for helping with stretch marks and aging hands. My mother has always used vitamin C on her hands, and as a result her hands look very young for her age! I am excited to try this serum for this purpose as well!

Vitamin C is known to help with fading scars, firming skin, and reducing inflammation. This serum also has other ingredients that are beneficial for the skin in terms of anti-aging, acne, and redness. Hyaluronic acid is amazing for the skin and it's something that everyone should be using on their face. This serum also has many other ingredients that are great for the skin.

14,5,"06 8, 2001",A141OPVE376YFI,B000050B65,"First, a little background.  I've switched between Norelco electric razors and blades over the years, never quite satisfied with the shave I was getting.  Norelco has always said ""shaves as close as a blade or your money back"".  I've never found this to be true, but the razors were good enough that I didn't return them.  Most recently I used the Gilette Mach 3 razor which does a very good job.
Now here's why I give the 6885XL (6886XL is apparently the same model, sold at Costco and other warehouse stores) 5 stars:
- Closest shave yet.  This is the first electric razor I've used that shaves as close as a blade (including the Mach 3).  In fact, it shaves closer than a blade under my jaw and around my adam's apple.  I can't shave against the grain with a blade in those areas or my skin breaks out (and that's the only way to get the closest shave.)  With the 6885XL I don't have this problem and I get a really close shave.
- It's quiet.  Previous electric razors were so noisy I had to shave in another bathroom so I wouldn't wake my wife.  Not so with this one.
- Easy to clean.  Open the top and run hot water through it.  No more brushes (except for periodic maintenance).  An indicator will tell you when it's time to clean.
Other features:
- Charge remaining (in minutes) display.  This isn't particularly useful to me, but it seems reasonable accurate.
- It comes with a stand that holds the razor upright on the counter or basin.  Much neater than the razor just laying around or stuffed in a cabinet.
- Hard carrying case, for travel.
- Automatically adjusts to different voltages.

Fortunately she likes the flavor of this Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection toothpaste. Described as ""mild bubble fruit,"" she just calls it bubblegum. I tried some myself and it is indeed mild. It reminded me of the bubblegum-flavored paste I used as a kid, though I didn't get any fruit flavors. Regardless, it's mild enough that even my picky kid - who hates ""spicy"" paste - liked this.

This is intended for six year olds and up, as it has pretty much an adult amount of fluoride (0.24%). The pump says that kids ages two to six can use a pea-sized amount. Obviously the concern here is potential swallowing.

It's been years since I've used a pump, and I forgot how much I liked them. This is virtually mess free, with a red button easy enough for my daughter to use in her own. All in all, I was extremely impressed by this toothpaste and might even use it from time to time myself. Recommended.",1470614400,0,0,0,0,1

Then I tried the least expensive Norelco model and experienced a completely clean shave for the first time in my life.  I was happy with that model, but it's managed to disappear, leading me to the 7240XL, which Amazon inexplicably had priced at $15-20 below the ""less deluxe,"" cosmetically blue 7140XL.  Small wonder that they sold out.  You may wish to wait to see if it's restocked at its former price, or simply elect to pay the higher freight.

This Norelco is more shaver than I need--slightly heavier and bigger than my previous, entry-level model, and it has a curious but I assume functional plastic ""shield"" (hair-catcher?).  Also, the trimmer is noisier (and ""sounds"" less powerful) than its predecessor.  But it delivers the same flawless performance and has niceties such as water-wash clean (I hardly dare to use it), adjustability to the curvature of the face, and automatic voltage selection.  The less expensive models offer the same, though the 7240XL is slightly more ""ergonomic"" (with the inclusion of a thumb and finger rest).  If you can forego the thumb rest and live with blue instead of silver, the 7140XL will serve you just as well, I'm sure, and currently at a significantly lower price (Amazon apparently caught on and adjusted the formerly upside-down pricing of the two models).",1198800000,0,0,0,0,1

I first found it online by doing a search for things with pumpkin in it, and now I'm on my 4th bottle of this and I also recommend the body lotion and face creams, I am slowly becoming totally enamored with this brand and always look forward to trying more things.

This wash beats soap anytime in the shower; the orange gelee collapses on itself when poured and feels cool and refreshing especially in the morning. I love the scent, its very delicate, smell like soft fruit scented air, nothing aggressive and doesn't feel too organic and strange but fancy enough. There is ginko biloba and cucumber water, green tea, chamomile, orange and of course carrots, silky aloe, cleansing Dead Sea water and even spirulina extract, which I have drank before but never used in products. It feels very light and my skin always feels clean but light, never dry and uncomfortable. The bottle is also large and lasts a while, which is nice.

As I get older it becomes more important to me to use as little chemicals as possible, of course in today&iexcl;s world we are bombarded with them and its hard since they appear in everything but still, ever little thing counts. Parabens for example are used as preservatives and are generally considered safe because of low levels of toxicity, but lately I keep reading how traces are found in cancer lumps especially in women and simply knowing that a cosmetic doesn't have it makes me happy.

So I ordered it, thinking that I already know what the color is like so I didn't need to worry about seeing it in person first before buying it. So when the compact arrived, I was surprised to find that the color had changed a bit. Instead of being a neutral/natural pink, it definitely has become a light, cool-tone pink.

Don't get me wrong, it is a super thick resin, with a consistency like molasses, but much thinner and less resinous than other benzoin I've used. It does have a beautiful scent and so far , so good as a fixative in my essential oil blends and homemade lotion. Sometimes don't you just wish you had a lab to test the purity of your oils? I do like thos benzoin and this styrax has a rich amber, vanilla scent. Personally I favor onycha but this styrax is quite a gorgeous scent.",1483142400,0,0,0,1,0

I was super excited to try lavender salts since of course it's the perfect scent for bath time. As it turns out, these were pretty good. Nothing miraculous and not super perfume-y, but they do add a little something special to tub time.

If I had to complain I would say that a little doesn't go a long way and with a bottle this small don't expect to get a lot of uses out of it. Also, the 'rocks' are very hard so it takes them a while to dissolve. I would let them soak for a bit before stepping in the tub to prevent sharp pain.

I have bought so many eyelash curlers that said they didn't pinch...but what did they do?  PINCHED!  I ordered the Star Tech Professional Grade Lady Beauty Tool Eyelash Curler (Pink) from Star Tech not believing the ""no pinch "" claim, but I just used it and it didn't pinch or hurt a single time!  I am so thrilled.  I love the handle.  The shape of it molds to your thumb and finger perfectly and makes it so much easier to use.  Very nice idea.  Another problem I have had many times is the curler actually sticking to mu eyelashes and pulling 1 or 2 out.  Again, that didn't happen with this one.  These are more lightweight than others I have used and curling my lashes is just a breeze.  The only thing that could have made these any better is if, perhaps, that had added an extra pink rubber piece to use when this one is worn.  I would highly recommend these eyelash curlers.  They are my new favorite!

We soaked our feet in water, washed and dried, and then filed the toenails. We applied a clear base coat. Two layers of this amethyst color and finally the top coat. Glossy and shiny results. On to the manicure, soaked our nails in mild soap and water, dried and filed our nails. Again, the same base coat. Two layers of the amethyst color and finally the top coat. We are a blazing color duo. I am usually more conservative in my colors, but I just love this amethyst on my toes and nails. We have received compliments, and people have requested the color and make of the polish.

48,5,"07 21, 2007",ABLOQZIL42W7I,B000067E30,"I am a dentist who recommends Crest-brand White Strips to my patients becasue they do work to whiten teeth. However, they have to be used correctly and I recommend that you follow the directions as specified inside the box.

1. Use the strips as directed on the box.  The instructions will tell you to bleach twice a day for 30-minutes a time.  The inner part of the strip has a chemical called hydrogen peroxide; (in-office, or dentist-assisted dental whitening uses a 15-35% version of the same chemical) that causes the stains inside your teeth to be oxidized and turn white. Applying the strips has a small learning curve as you will probably bend or fold a couple of them before you get the technique down.

2. Leave the strips on for the time recommended in the instructions and do not overbleach your teeth, as this leads to sensitivity.

Disadvantages

1. Hydrogen Peroxide can ""burn"" your gums. If you notice a burning sensation when you use the product, it is the chemical oxidizing (or burning) your gums (it will turn them white with a minor chemical burn). Depending on how severe the burning is, it may cause you to want to stop the treatment. It is OK to stop the treatment for a day or two to let the gums heal. Once they are healed, resume treatment with the White Strips. Try to not get the strip on your gums.

2. Your teeth may become senstiive during the week treatment time. Try to tolerate the sensitivity if it is mild, but if more severe, take a day or two off to let the teeth settle down and then pick up where you left off. You may notice much more sensitivity to cold water, ice cream, etc.  The peroxide causes a reversible inflamation of the inner pulp, or nerve center of the tooth and makes the teeth very sensitive to biting or cold drinks or foods.  If your teeth become too sensitive, back off on the strips until the sensitivity is gone before resuming bleaching.

3. The strips only cover your front teeth, so only your front teeth will bleach. You may notice the distinct difference between the back (unbleached) teeth and the front (bleached) teeth. Since most people notice the front 6 teeth anyway, this is not a big deal. However, if you have a wide toothy smile, you may want to have a dentist make you a tray that will hold the chemical on the back teeth to whiten them too.

4. The bleaching effect works best on yellow stains. If your stains are due to tetracycline (brownish grey stains in a band on your teeth, your best bet is to begin bleaching with yoru dentist and then use the strips to continue the bleaching process.

Now comes the confusing part: Crest White Strips come in 4 different packages, each a bit different than the others.  The main difference is in the strength of the hydrogen peroxide, and the price.  The higher the dose of hydrogen peroxide, the most costly the product package.  Here are the 4 packages:  1. Crest White Strips Classic (6% hydrogen peroxide, 14-day treatment).  2. Crest White Strips Premium (10% hydrogen peroxide, 7-day treatment).  3. Crest White Strips Premium Plus (10% hydrogen peroxide, and has 12 additional strips).  4. Crest White Strips Renewal (9.5% hydrogen peroxide).  The cheapest method (at around 25 dollars, is the Crest Classic Whitestrips, but it takes 2 weeks to complete the treatment).  Premium and Premium Pro are both 10% peroxide formulations, work in 7-10 days, and the ""Premuim-Plus"" gives you 12 additional strips.  I am not sure why Crest recently came out with ""Renewal"", as it is a 9.5% hydrogen peroxide formulation which is not significantly different from the 10% concentration. Leave it to the manufacturer to confuse the consumer!

Crest White Strips work for the vast majority of people. Younger people with yellow stains seem to respond better than older people or those with gray stains.

If you are not satisfied with the results and still want whiter teeth, you can then see your dentist for a more concentrated form of bleaching.  This is much more expensive, but the concentration of hydrogen peroxide is much higher and this works better on stubbornly-stained teeth.

I was new to face peels.  This came with a e-book that described the process.  I got some baking soda, and a new artist's paintbrush and cottonballs, as recommended, to do my first peel.  It was easy.  The instructions had said for the first time to be only 2 minutes.  I used a kitchen timer and using the eyedropper and the brush, applied the 30% glycolic acid solution and left it on for 2 minutes.  It tingled a bit but that was all.

My face didn't look much different afterwards.  It was easy to get off.  My face felt a bit dry, so I followed up with hyaluronic acid serum.  I never did note any peeling, and I didn't have any redness, but in the days to follow I did notice that my skin seemed a bit brighter.  The next time I left it on for 5 minutes, because my face is pretty tough.  This time I felt a bit more tingling and I did have a bit of flaking.  My skin looks much brighter over all, and it seemed like it lightened my faded freckles up even more.

I like the product and will continue to use it until I find that sweet spot of time that's just right for me.  I can see where this treatment does help skin to look younger and more clear.  I haven't had any real progress with fine lines, but I can tell the potential is there and will happen with time and more treatments.  There's enough in the bottle for MANY treatments.

First of all, I will state that this is a cosplay wig, so do not expect this to look super natural like wigs that cost upwards of $150 dollars.
But, having said that, I am VERY impressed at the quality of this piece, especially at the price point. First of all, it's synthetic but it doesn't have the SUPER high-shine that most synthetic wigs have. Secondly, it's THICK! Many others in this price range are not even half as full and thick as this one, which speaks well of the quality and workmanship.
I love the length of the wig, it easily came down over my chest, and has a beautiful curl to it.
The color of the blonde is a very natural color, which I was pleasantly surprised by.
Also, the bangs are thick and full, meaning that they won't fall to the side and suddenly reveal the wig cap. I personally plan to point-cut the bangs a little, to customize and thin it just a little bit. (I am a licensed hair stylist. I would NOT recommend trimming the bangs unless you are confident in how to do it, because you could easily ruin the wig.)
I wore this wig for about an hour, and at one point I was dancing around the living room with my kids. The wig stayed firmly in place, AND felt breathable. So many synthetic wigs are known for making your head itchy and sweaty, but this one was totally comfortable the entire time I wore it.
Because it's synthetic, it did start to snag just a little bit, but simple finger-combing made the ends look sleek again.
I was also highly impressed with the quality of this wig because I did not notice ANY shedding, seriously, not one single strand came out!!!

Overall, this wig has changed my opinion of synthetic fibers in hairpieces, and I will no longer assume that they are all low quality and uncomfortable. This one is HIGH quality, COMFORTABLE and SEXY! Seriously, I can not say it enough, this wig ROCKS!!

5017,5,"09 24, 2010",A2BVRKJ12P1HDY,B00C6NZH3E,"I'm 48 and I have been shaving with Norelco Electric Razors since I was about 16.  My first Norelco was a hand me down from my Grandfather, a two header.  My Great Grandfathers, Grandfather and Dad have all shaved with Norelcos. I collect them and have a vast number in my collection.  I have had them to go out before and Philips Norelco was always quick to replace the defective model.  My pride and joy of my Norelcos is my Spectra 8894xl James Bond Electric Razor. It give a very close shave and I still shave with it once and awhile. I recently replaced the blades in it and it still delivers a close comfortable shave. I am always looking for a way to get a close shave with an electric.  I have a refurbished Smart Touchxl and it to shaves really close. Now on to Senso Touch 1250cc.  I purachased a Senso Touch 1250x at Walmart for $217 including tax, then I saw the 1250cc on Amazon from Electronic Sonic for only $225 and with fast shipping, the total price was $235. I returned the 1250x back to Walmart and got the 1250cc on Amazon from Electronic Sonic.  I was able to get the razor with the jet clean system on Amazon for only $18 more, a deal! I checked around at Target and a few other stores and there were no stores in my state that carried the 1250cc only the 1250x. It took only 3 days to receive this razor.  It ships by UPS.  I have a heavy dark beard and usually have to shave twice a day.  I never did get a close shave with my Arcitec 1050cc. It took me about 7 min. to get anything that even resembled a descent shave.  I gave my Arcitec to my Dad 68 who has a light beard and he loves it. All I can say about the shave that I get from Senso Touch is WOW! It is close and leaves your face feeling really smooth! I shave with it both wet and dry, but the wet shave is very comfortable and resembles the shave that I use to get with my old Cool Skin which was only a wet shaver. The razor comes in a big box and resembles a present. It is very expensive, but let me tell you, this razor is worth the extra money! It  takes a while to open it which in it are several smaller boxes which contain various parts of the shaving system. It really is a shaving system and it is was well worth the extra money. In the box, you will find the razor, the jet clean system, a bottle of jet clean solution, a charging stand ( charging stand does not come with the Arcitec 1050cc ), a soft pouch ( which is much better than the storage and charging pod of the Arcitec 1050cc ), a cleaning  brush, a protective cap, a power cord, and a quick start guide, and a useage booklet. On the razor itsself is a 3 level battery display which shows: cleaning indicator, battery high and low indicators which are shown in blocks, replacement head indicator, and travel lock indicator. This is a ruby black frame with a hidden display.  The razor has the GyroFlex 3D System, UltraTrack Heads, and SkinGlide System. This razor is Aquatec which means you can shave with it both wet and dry. This razor has a EasyGrip which ensures complete control and extra precision. The razor heads unlike the Arcitec can be taken apart and each one cleaned individually and you can wash out the razor and just let it dry. The jet clean system, which is very cool to watch in action, cleans and lubracates the razor heads.  I plan to use it about once a week to save on the cleaning solution.  Now when I shave, I use Afta Pre Electric and a little talc which helps to deliver a smooth shave. I do not use Williams Lectric Shave anymore as it cloggs the razor and it is very greasey.  Afterwards, I put on a little Nivea Post Shaving Balm.  When I shave wet, I use Nivea Shaving Gel. Philips tells you to wait about 3 weeks for your face to get ajusted to this shaving system.  I did experience a little irritation, red burn, on the lower part of my nck, but it could be due to fact I pressed too hard with the razor, but it is getting better evertime I shave. I love this razor and I am very happy with my purchase on Amazon. Like I said this razor is expensive, but I am a Pastor and I want to look good in the pulpit and this razor, so far is getting the job done! You can get the razor with a numeric display, but this model is sufficient for me.  If you have any questions concerning this razor please email me at: [...] Happy Shaving, Michael, Baton Rouge, LA",1285286400,0,0,0,0,1

It was a little tricky learning to start it in my mouth and then letting the water drizzle out without splattering, but time and habit solved everything.

Just had my three month checkup and everything was sparkling clean around both the implant and my remaining teeth.

One small amusement: the carrying case has holders for four tips but the unit comes with six. Luckily the fifth wheel, as it were, fits in the carrying case even though there is no slot for it.

Swish and pik away!

It's a freaking great idea. You aren't gooping up your manicure by sticking your finger in the jar, and more importantly, you aren't contaminating the products even if you just washed your hands.

I bought a pack of 25, which will serve for eternity since they are thick, sturdy and perfect for endless reuses (you can throw them in a small mesh bag and run them through the dishwasher if sterilization is important to you.)

Another thing they work great on is samples. If you get a lot of samples (I do) and some come in a jar, the samples will last a lot longer since you'll bet getting a precise amount out of the container for your needs. No waste, and no mess! Oh, and I received the spatulas from China in less than two weeks, so it was definitely worth the wait for the price.

This mirror polish is fun but not 100% what I was expecting. For some reason, I expected my nails to have a foil finish like the Amazon listing. It is VERYYY shiny, but not 100% foil. The set comes with two bottles and there is a ton of polish in each bottle, one bottle is actual silver and the other is a special top coat.

The silver is almost like a regular silver polish from Orly or Julep. I have both silvers in both brands and its almost identical. I have to give it to the polish that it is very shiny but like I said, not foil like. When I apply this, I needed 2 coats. Just one coat was too thin and I could see my nail through. The two coats were perfect. I also coated with a clear polish  Seche Vite. The set came with a clear top coat but this top coat was VERY weird. It had the STRONGEST chemical scent I have EVER smelled, and I was wondering if it was actually UV/LED top coat??? It took FOREVER to dry and my fingers were BURNING the whole time. I had to take off the first application of silver and redo the whole thing with the Seche Vite after the clear polish was causing too much pain around my cuticles.. However, the whole drying time of this was VERY fast once I put the Seche Vite & Silver on and I appreciated that I didn't have to sit around for hours waiting for my manicure to dry. Also, its hard to apply this and not get streak marks. I don't know how they applied it so flawlessly in the photographs.

The polish lasted a surprisingly long time and did not chip or fade. Usually I only get 2 wear days max with regular polish before it starts chipping and I look like a hotmess. This lasted almost four days before chips occurred. On my toes  it lasted a good week before I took it off to redo my pedicure. The bottles are also surprisingly easy to hold and they are a larger size standard polish bottle. The polish was easy to clean off (its not like glitter polish that takes hours to scrap) but I just used a cotton ball and standard remover and it was gone in less than a minute. Overall, if you are expecting foil polish this is not for you, but if you want a good, silver shiny polish, this is PERFECT! 4/5 stars

After brushing my teeth with the toothpaste I follow up with this mouth wash. It's very foamy which means it gets through every crevice and space between your teeth. The texture is real smooth and there's no burning sensation.
  Within a few days I noticed my teeth were a lot whiter, and by the time I was finished with the bottle my teeth were ""3D"" white! They're sparkling, shining, and pearly white. I highly recommend you use this in addition with the Glamorous White toothpaste. I can't afford the Whitestrips to buy often, so this mouth wash - which has the same ingredient as the Whitestrips - is a great alternative.

Let it remain on your face while soaping up and be sure not to get any of it into your eyes, it does sting. When you're ready to rinse, this product rinses off clean and there's no greasy residue left behind.

What I wasn't expecting was that my hair would feel so wonderfully soft and full after the first wash! It lathered beautifully with just a dab of shampoo, rinsed easily and without being fly-away or unmanageable at all, my hair is really so soft. I'm kinda stunned. (As I always do, I rubbed actual coconut oil on my hands and then ran my hands through my hair before blow-drying. But I've always done that. My hair has never felt this good so it isn't because of the light coconut oil finish.)

This cream doesn't really smell anything like coconut oil, but more like a clean baby -- I don't know why.

To note -- at the time I ordered this I didn't realize it was coming from a company in the UK, where I'm not. They delivered in a timely manner, given that the package was sailing across a very large pond, but I'll look for this product from a US distributor the next time I order.

I HAVENT SEEN THAT UNGREDIENT IN OTHER VITAMIN C SERUMS THAT I HAVE TRIED.

IVE BEEN SEEING LOTS OF ARTICLES AND POSTS ON VITAMIN C SERUMS AND CREAMS IN MAGAZINE ARTICLES, ON LINE, ON TELEVISION, AND ON BLOGS, SO I DECIDED TO GIVE IT A TRY AND IM ABSOLUTELY AMAZED WITH THE RESULTS THAT I AM STARTING TO EXPeRIENCE!!

AT THIS POINT IVE TRIED 6 DIFFERENT TOPICAL VITAMIN C'S, THIS BEING MY SIXTH, VITAMIN C PRODUCT, AND FOURTH THAT IS A SERUM AND NOT A CREAM.

I HAVE A REALLY BIG BELLY BUTTON SCAR FROM MY TUBLIGATION, AND THIS IS THE THIRD SERUM THAT I TRIED ON IT. I AM ON DAY 9 OF USING THIS VITAMIN C PRODUCT,. THIS IS WHAT I HAVE DONE WITH THE PREVIOUS VITAMIN C SERUMS AND WIlllWITH THIS ONE TOO AS I AM ALREADY NOTICING A CHANGE ON DAY 3. FIRST, I STARTED OFF USING THE SERUM ONLY ONCE A DAY TO SEE IF I ACTUALLY SEE RESULTS, AND TO MAKE SURE THAT IT AGREES WITH MY SKIN AS WELL. AFTER 3 DAYS OF USING IT MY SCAR HAD NOTICABLY LIGHTENED UP AND I HAD NO TROUBLE USING IT, SO I INCREASED MY DAILY USAGE UP TO TWO TIMES A DAY, I WOULD APPLY IT IN THE MORNING BEFORE GETTING DRESSED AND AGAIN AT NIGHT BEFORE BED. I HAVE 5 CHILDREN, SO I DO NOT HAVE A SET SHOWERING SCHEDULE, I THROW ONE IN WHEN I CAN, SO OBVIOUSLY WEATHER IT WAS MORNING OR NIGHT I APPLIED THE VITAMIN C AFTER MY SHOWER.

These are very cute, very affordable decals. I like that each sheet is individually wrapped (though I think the instructions on the packets would be pretty incomprehensible for anyone not already familiar with this technique).  For some reason, though, I'm having a harder time applying these than I have had with other brands of water slip decals. I think perhaps these are thinner. The thinness could be a real plus once the decal is actually in place, because it lies very smoothly on the nail. But for now, I'm fumbling with edges that curl back or fold in on themselves, and wasting time and material in the process This could just be my lack of skill.

So I would say that for someone experienced with this technique these could  be a very good buy. I would not recommend them for beginners. I really wish I could love them, but for now a like is as good as I can do.",1461024000,0,0,0,1,0

A poncho is a single large sheet of fabric with an opening in the center, it may have a hood, it can be made out of different materials, but it does not have sleeves. This garment does. So it is not a poncho.

I would describe it as a loose fitting blouse with a large cowl neck. The neckline that is flowy and either drapes down or can be stretch over one or two shoulders. The blouse is made out of thin material, so it drapes well. Its loose fit is flattering as it does not cling to reveal fat rolls or any other body imperfections.

The material is thin, but I have worn it to work this week (we are having a cold December) by layering a sweater under it. I got the XL-3X size, but it is not too big as drapes well. The material is 95% Viscose and 5% Spandex. It is quite thin, but this what makes it drape well. The yoke is made out of double fabric, so it has a little more structure than the top itself. The sleeves are 3/4 length, they fit me comfortably. I wear it with the draped neckline it over pant/jeans. I got the one in black color so I spice it up with colorful scarves and layer with sweaters. This blouse is not a high end couture. It is a casual outfit. It does not look out of place at my work place.

Manufacturers instructions recommend to wash in cold water with similar colors. I washed the blouse by hand to see if it is colorfast, and discovered that it is colorfast and does not bleed, but it sheds black fibers. I washed 5 times and continued to shed fibers. This fibers are not individual threads, they look like fuzz. I am including a photo of what was left in my sink as the water draned. The fabric does not shed when it was dry, and when I took it off there was no shedding on my sweater.

So what's the bottom line? Not bad for a casual looking blouse, but overpriced due to the celebrity endorsement.

This poncho is provided by 3 Way Poncho.

I'm always a little leery of brushing since I don't want to ruin my brushes or potentially harm my nightguard. Soaking it in some mouthwash is helpful, but then that isn't the same as a thorough clean.

The taste of this is fairly nice. I like that it's not extremely overwhelming. You can wipe your guard down and it won't be insanely strong. There will be a hint of flavor, but overall it's not going to be anything that will knock your socks off. This might be disappointing for some, but it's still a better thing to taste than the alternative. If you have a guard of any type, you know what I'm talking about.

This will get into most of the crevices and areas of the average guard. You'll have to cram it into the more small areas, but it will fit everywhere. It seems to do a fairly good job of cleaning as well. I'd read that it could help get rid of stains and other discolorations, which is the biggest thing that appealed to me. So far I've done a few cloths and it seems to be helping a little. It's not a miracle worker, but then I wasn't expecting it to be and to be honest, I'd be more than a little leery of something that would remove all the yellowing immediately. After all, what would it do to your mouth afterwards?

This is a pretty good option and I'm curious to try the soaks to see what they would do as well.",1398988800,0,0,0,1,0

It isn't that they are big though, they just really stretch out to fit.  they work great, they feel just a bit scratchy but in use they make a soap lather well and really help get the top layer of dead skin off so that when I towel off, I just get clean and don't end up with rolls of skin that should have been washed away.  It seems like at least once a week I shed skin like crazy if I don't exfoliate, so I've used gloves like this for a few years now.

These are about the same quality as most others I've used, although I have used worse.  The price is a bit high perhaps but I am glad they are offered online.  The pair I got had strong seams, but if I have any issues with them not lasting a normal period of time, I will update the review.

The pair I received was a gorgeous aqua color.  They come nicely labeled and would look nice as part of a homemade gift basket.

These come in handy too before using fake tanning creams or lotions.  They will shorten the life of a tan though and can be used to help get rid of fake tan streaks or splotches.  They do wear out.  I don't keep mine but at most a month even if they still look ok.  I have never seen a recommended lifespan on them.

Also, the combs attach in a very similar snap-on and hold with dot concept.  They are difficult to get on/off.  I have only used this maybe ten times, and now the foil starts falling out all the time.  The dots fail to hold it any more.

Without the combs, it is too ""dangerous"" for trimming sensitive areas.  With the combs, it is too clunky/bulky, and you have to go over the area about ten times.  I found an old electric Wahl-type trimmer (with combs) works a lot better and faster.  Finally, the charger base is a stupid waste of space and plastic and often the contacts don't work unless you really pay attention or jiggle it.  A conventional plug would have been a lot better.

The Pre De Provence lavender spray smells fabulous. Not the least bit musty, which some lavender sprays can get a bit of a musty undertone, not this one.

First, they are thinner than Jamberry.  DO NOT HEAT THEM,  They will curl.  I do not detect any smell either, and I have a good sniffer. Here is what I do to apply them. First, I find a base coat of polish which is the same color as the background of the wrap. I use Sally Hanson because it is inexpensive.  I do this because I do not like seeing where the nail wrap ends if it is a little small.  I apply that first. Usually only one coat, but sometimes two.  Then I clean the nail with alcohol wipes.  Next I measure my nails, and start sticking the wrap on. They are a little difficult to get off the plastic. I suggest using the wood end of the stick they give you AND tweezers which are not provided. I apply the nail wrap carefully, smooth it down the  I file the excess off and atain press down the wrap very tightly.  Next I apply a few coats of Sally Hanson top coat.  I am using ""Super Shine"" which I believe is less than 2.50 at Wal Mart. I like the high gloss shine, but they have mat finishes as well.  I will periodically apply additional top coats.  I can wear them for at least two weeks with little problems.  Occasionally one or two will lift.  I bought a paint on nail glue to put under the lifted part and then I press the wrap down with the wooden rod which comes with the wraps. This corrects the problem.

It serves as a great moisturizer for dry skin and is known as a hair revitalizer"" and ""helps stimulate follicles to encourage growth and helps nourish your hair from the root to help it look healthier"".

I'm happy to report that the mascara IS waterproof, applies smoothly without clumps, and makes lashes look long, natural and defined.

The serum is in a small glass vial with a rubber stopper on top to prevent leaks and spills. Also included was a flexible rubberized dropper tip. The dropper tip fits securely on the opened vial and you simply turn it over and let the serum fall into the tip and gently squeeze out using your fingers to get precise drop applications (see pic). It's a very nice dispensing mechanism and one that I've never seen before.

I was interested in trying this product because of the purported benefits of snail mucus in skincare. Snail secretion filtrate is suppose to help with DNA repair and resiliency  and is said to be good for both acne prone skin and dry, aging skin. The consistency of the serum is quite gel-like. It's very thick but it feels most like glycerin. As mentioned, it's quite easy to dispense dropperfuls of product where you need them. I've been using it for a few days and while I haven't noticed dramatic differences, it does seem to hydrate and plump the area in which I place it (mostly fine lines and wrinkles). A quick look at the ingredient list shows there is snail secretion filtrate in it, but it's not near the top. I know you can get serums contain snail secretion filtrate where it's the first or second ingredient.

It is winter now so we don't use them anymore, but for the other three seasons, whenever we are out in risky areas, like in the woods, while hiking, etc., we always put one bracelet on one wrist and another bracelet on the ankle ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE. That way we get full protection up and down, and left and right.

They are effective in most normal situations, but we found that there are times they don't fully protect us. Not that we were bitten big time, but when you see mosquitoes hovering around near you, you know they are ready to bite. Here are the conditions:

1) If we are on the move a lot
2) If it is unusually cold
3) If it is windy

My guess is that since these bracelets rely on your body heat to percolate a steady ""cloud"" of the oil of citronella, geranium, lemon grass, lavender, etc, to surround you, the above are those conditions when the ""cloud"" is prevented from forming or staying around you. The good news is that these are also conditions under which mosquitoes are less prone to bother you. The rest of the time, the bracelets work like a charm. We did a lot of drive in theatre weekends this summer, and these were the best.

It's important not to go too light because the blush WILL look chalky or there will be no color payoff. So far these colors have been most flattering
1. Mata hari
Matte mauve pink. Gorgeous for everyday adds a natural looking flush to the cheeks. It is lighter than MAC slave to love blush which was one of my old favorites before I tried NARS!
2. Taos
Described as a dusty rose, but has coral tones on my skin tone. Has some shimmer but not very noticeable once applied to the skin. This one is very long lasting. Nice for brightening up your day...and your complexion!
3. Taj mahal
Looks very gold in the pan but adds such a pretty warmth to the cheeks that's a little shimmery and lit from within. There are many ravs about this blush on beauty blogs and YouTube and its true!
4. Desire
A scary bright bright bright pink in the pan but also very good quality giving cheeks the natural flush you crave for everyday. I've also seen this one on deeper skin tones and it still looks natural and flattering
5. Love joy
I was wondering if this would show up or just look like shimmer on my skin. After application it was a brownish berry color with slight shimmer and the blush I choose when I'm doing a strong smoky or colorful eye look. Looks very natural on my skin tone. Can't really be used to contour because it has the berry tone. The nars site describes this of a bronzed rose but on skin tones similar to mine would be berry toned.
6. Exhibit A
I've seen this on light medium and deep skin tones and it is widely flattering! Turns more red than orange on my skin but can look more orange on you depending on your undertones. Every woman should have this one in their arsenal. Some people believe this gives the most natural looking flush of all. It also photographs really well and looks good on video! Lol :)

Start your collection with any one of these if you're skin tone is similar to mine. NARS blush is one of the best blush brands out there I encourage you to try at least one even thought they have a higher price point. They are very pigmented and last a long time too!",1343952000,0,0,0,0,1

I have been using this for two weeks now and found the best way to apply it is to add a drop or two to my regular face cream, then apply. Otherwise you get a sort of yellow tanned look that takes a bit to rub in and disappear. I found using it along with the face cream was the fastest and easiest way to apply it.

The oil is sort of yellow like a turmeric oil and contains rosehip, neroli, chamomile, rose, frankincense, lavender, and bisalolol essential oils. So you can see how healing this also is. I don't notice any scent from the oil it seems relatively mild. I think this bottle is going to last me a long time since I use so little of it. The results are great (including smaller pores!) and I'm happy I tried this product. It is a time saver since I don't have to blend my own oils.

I have been using this cream every morning before I apply my daily makeup. This cream did not have any negative effects on my makeup application. I actually feel like this cream helped my makeup adhere to my skin and last longer than it has in the past! This cream is very easy to apply and absorbs quickly into my skin. The cream itself does feel very luxurious. It doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy, which is super important to me. I have been using this smoothing treatment cream on both my face and neck. It's important to take care of your neck as you do your face. This Amelie Skincare facial moisturizer also has a light and pleasant scent. It's definitely been a treat to use this on my skin!

$11.26

It is made in Tahiti and has a real vanilla bean in the bottom of the bottle.  Because it has coconut oil in it, it solidifies at 68 degrees, but all you have to do is put it into your hand and it melts.  It smells SO GOOD!  It also has Tiare flower scent in it that the Bath & Body Works formula had as well as Vitamin E and actual vanilla bean fragrance from a real vanilla bean.  It is only 4 ounces, but a little goes a long way and is only $11.26.

I was able to wrap it around, but found the tightness of the largest setting uncomfortable.  If you are a larger size, they offer a similar product in XL that might work better for you.

Other than being too snug for long term comfort, this worked very well at supporting my back in just the spots I was hoping it would help.

I have to say I have a couple different foot sander type products, but nothing like this electric callus remover.
I started my Pedicure with my usual foot soak routine, as my daughter decided just to dive right in a use the Callus remover on her dry feet. She was amazed at how quickly it worked! The foot dust was flying! It really made quick work out of her feet and left them so soft and smooth!

My feet on the other hand were not nearly as nice.
So today, I decided to change the file head and try this on my dry feet.
Oh my gosh! This IS THE BEST Callus Remover I have ever had the pleasure of using! My feet  are so smooth and nice after less than 5 mins! No need for the 20 minute foot soak and 30 minute filing and buffing, just charge up this tool and go to work on DRY FEET!
In less than 15 mins both your feet will look and feel like you just went to a spa! Amazing results.
The product cam nicely boxed with clear instructions, Callus filer and 2 sanding heads, a storage cover and a/c charger. Took about 6 hours to charge and worked excellent.
I'm really looking forward to having nice smooth feel all the time now, with this handy tool!
Please note that for hygiene purposes you are not supposed to share the sanding heads. This product came with 2 so I labeled one for my daughter and one for myself.
Very ergonomic to hold and use. I normally have issues with my hands cramping up and I did not get that feeling when using this!

The pills don't taste that good and start dissolving upon contact with water. I take them with lots of water. So far my shedding as increased and is causing me concern. I haven't seen a change in the condition of my hair or balding areas yet and no uptake in growth rate either.

Of note, I was already taking most of the ingredients listed as contained in Toji in other supplements. So I expected this to kick in quicker since I have the vitamins, herbs and minerals already in my system for the last several (6-8) months. That hasn't happened but I'm  Still hopeful , I will update in another 30 days.

Updated_ July 27

Two days away from concluding my second bottle and so far....I have no increase in my hair growth ( i only get 1/8"" a month) , no increase in shine ( my hair's still frizzy and unruly) or thickness either( still thinning with bald spots).  I have increased shedding and breakage since I started to take these, which is upsetting to me.  My fingernails do seems to grow fast but that is all that I have noticed.  I am not happy with my experience  taking these so far.

Update August 28- added stars to my rating.

Beginning my fourth bottle and I'm finally noticing a betterment in my hair. It still grows slowly but I have noticeably growing hair at my edges. Shedding and breakage has decreased and my hair seems a  little thicker. . It looks much better than it did three months
ago or even one month ago.

Update at 4 months: September 25

Still no faster growth and only minor thickening. I've reduced my dosage to half... One in the morning and one in evening and so far no change in the condition of my hair. From my last update. i think ive gotten all I'll  get from these. I plan to continue two a day for the time  being until I can find something else.

Final review october 2013

I no longer take these. I saw only minor improvement in the condition of my hair after almost 5 months at high dosage, which was four a day. My fingernails grew pretty fast but that's it.  I saw no regrowth in bald/thinning areas and no change in growth rate either.  I've stopped taking them and so far, nothing happened. No shedding or breaking etc. Seemed they weren't that effective for me. Very pricey fail.

February 2014 second try

I'm desperate to stop my hair loss so I'm giving these another try. It seems they were effective in slowing my loss and some increase in thickness. Since I stopped taking them it seems my hair went back to very thin.  It took about three months to show. So if this worked and I didn't notice it's worth a second try. I need it bad because nothing else is working. I started two a day for one month January and now back up to 4 for the next three. I will update in 30.",1372982400,0,1,0,0,0

My very fair-skinned face is over 70 years old, and I think, in very good shape...thank goodness for good genes.  This product comes in a nice glass bottle with a rubber dropper in the cap for applying 1 or 2 drops. The scent is pleasant and light, hardly noticeable.  One week has gone by and I cannot see any noticeable difference using this Illuminating Essence (no glowing from within...yet!).  The only thing noticed were a few small red blotches (no bumps) that are finally disappearing.  After applying the white pearly liquid, my skin seems to have a coating that does not allow my moisturizer (cheap=Ponds Dry Skin Cream) to sink in.  That is really not a problem as the SK-ll CAIE makes my skin feel smooth and pliable on it's own. If anything, I would say that it's a nice product,... pricey,...and might be helpful for others.  PS:  The review written by ZenWoman was most helpful (she really did her homework!)...scared me at first, but I was intrigued and curious enough to give it a try!

Two of them are excellent--the smaller ones which measure 0.75 inch in length.  But the other two have very long blades--1.25 inches--which means that they're dangerously difficult to control.  I don't mean dangerous as in deadly, but dangerous as in imprecise.  If you're shaving sideburns this might not be a problem, but I'd be too scared to put a blade this long near my eyebrow.  One false move, and you could be missing a huge patch of hairs!  If you don't have the steady hands of a surgeon, I wouldn't recommend using the long blades on your face.  The short blades are a lot easier to handle, and block less of your view.

So you just have to use the right tool for the job.  If you need to do fine detailing, definitely stick to the small blades, and save the large blades for non-face areas!

I remember you could buy two of the one ounce for around $100 and receive another free.  Of course I didn't buy that deal the first time.  I just bought one bottle and I have my own business and had plenty of opportunity to try it out to see if it would increase trust in clients and my own office staff.
I was not in a hurry to make a snap judgment, however I found that it did not attract men or women sexually, but it did increase trust a great deal.
Most of the clients already knew me and this gave a distinctive increase in the trust level and I could feel that trust.  Most wanted to stay around a little longer and visit more and open up more about conversations about any subject.  A woman will not be interested in a man unless she trusts him.  I am married so I was not interested in attracting women for a sexual reason however I did find that many more women were friendly and very open, even on a first time meeting.  Any normal man will like that interaction even if he isn't just out to get anything and everything from women, which incidentally is not very moral in my book.  To each his own though.  We all answer for our mistakes so user beware in some cases.
Trust is the first and most important first impression no matter whether the relationship is business or personal.  I found men to be much more interested in visiting and maybe a fishing trip or whatever  --- basketball  --- hike ---  canoeing.  Sports minded men always need to find other men who share in sports minded activities.  Trust is just as important in those type clean relations.  I have to say Liquid Trust is an incredible tool in most cases if used with good intentions.  It's easier to trust someone who isn't always looking at a woman's crotch or breasts.
No, I don't work for the company and I am surprised that some others have found the Liquid Trust to be useless.  I suspect, if they are long haired yippie bippies who haven't showered in two weeks, it might just be difficult to get any woman to trust them especially if the body odor is much stronger than the Liquid Trust.",1428537600,0,0,0,0,1

Having used an older model of the Waterpik, I found this new Ultra unit to be significantly quieter and easier to use. The pressure control is now on the base unit and the motor sounds quieter and smoother. With the old model, it sounded like a Sherman tank fired up and I have to close the bathroom door to avoid disturbing anyone else in the house.

The tips are different, so you have to buy replacement tips designed for WP-100 which isn't that well advertised. In my opinion, the manufacturer should have streamlined the tip design so that they used one design/variety and interchange it among models like Oral B does with its electric toothbrushes. The Oral B unit I bought in the mid 1990s uses the same brushes as the new Oral B 5000 I purchased earlier this year.

The spare tips for the Waterpik Ultra are stored in a lid that clips to the reservoir which I think is a faulty idea. I almost broke the lid trying to remove it to fill up the reservoir, and I had no place to put it in the meantime. I almost broke it twice so I just kept it in the box. Waterpik should have kept the tip holder in the base unit to make it convenient for the user.

I normally just use line floss and my hygienist and dentist both agree that my gums look fine, but I use the Waterpik just for extra cleaning.

One day I saw the Cococare Cocoa Butter Stick at CVS and decided to give it a try. I rubbed the stick on my feet followed by a touch of olive oil. The mixture kept my feet supple and moisturized all day while I walked around in sandals! The mixture absorbed into my skin wonderfully.

I take being a tester very seriously and only accept products for testing if the seller confirms that they want an honest review after a several weeks of testing, good or bad.  I have a history of leaving critical reviews on regular basis.

I have to confess that I have not been very selective about shaving cream for my under arms.  All the stuff I used in the past have been pretty much the same.  This Cash and Bash serum is really different.  The shaving serum feels like you are applying clear oily moisturizer. It does not foam it does not look like shaving cream.  It goes on clear.  It covers my skin with somewhat oily film and the razor just glided over it removing all the little hairs.  The skin is left very smooth still having some of the oily film that was not removed by the action of the razor. Washing with water removes the oily left overs leaving a very smooth skin. Nice!  I did not use much just a small amount for each under arm.  The scent is very subtle, slightly fruity.

After washing off the remnants of the serum I applied a small drop of cream. It also has a very subtle scent, more vanilla than mint.  It felt non-greasy and when I put on a shirt right after applying it did not stain the shirt.

The serum comes in a small pump bottle.  The bottle is 4.5"" tall (not counting the pump) and holds 4 oz.

SERUM INGREDIENTS:
Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Oil, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol Dipelargonate, Aqua (Water), Sucrose Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Sucrose Stearate, Parfum, Tocopherol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alcohol, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Alchemilla Vulgaris Extract, Malva Sylvestris (Mallow) Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Primula Veris Extract, Veronica Officinalis Extract, Benzyl Benzoate, Coumarin, Linalool, Benzyl Cinnamate

I think of shaving as an unpleasant task that must be done and I do it as infrequently I can get away with.  The Cash & Bash serum/cream combo made it much better. No razor burn.

The biggest problems I have with with this scrub are the unnatural dyes, they could've been left out there is no need for them. In my opinion the dye almost cheapens the perceived value of the product as the color is very bright and unnatural. It exfoliates very lightly. All in all I would not consider buying this product for myself again.

Likes:
- Hydrates your face.
- Seems to tone and reduce appearance of pores.
- Tolerated by my very sensitive skin.

Dislikes:
- Documentation.  The package includes none.  How do I apply it.  Do I put sunscreen over it?  I was able to find more information online.
- Science.  For the price, I'd expect some studies to be published.  I only found mention of a company-sponsored study on the sk-ii dot com website. Even a breakdown of what it contains (i.e. results of a chemistry spectroscopy test) would be interesting, to me.
- Difficult to apply only a couple drops at a time: found needing more like 5 drops to get coverage.

Verdict:
If you are willing to pay the high price and want to try and see if it works for you, go for it.

This product is a bit of an unknown to me.  It certainly contains moisture and a bunch of nutrients that are a byproduct of the yeast fermentation that the product is derived from.  Subjectively it feels good and I feel like my skin looks better after using it for three weeks.  It feels like it is doing something: there is a sensation of warmth / firmness it give you.

I keep a very short beard and mustache (see my ""Profile"" picture) so do a trim every two or three days. Since I am also getting older, there is now a lot more hair where there aught not to be hair (ears, nose, eyebrows, etc) and fortunately this set has attachments to handle all of those needs.

The set comes with the handy caddy tray that holds the attachments and the charger cord can be connected through the bottom so the trimmer recharges when it is seated. The trimmer can easily run through three or four of my sessions without needing to be recharged, which is great when traveling since it is often not necessary to bring my whole kit along.

My only real issue with the trimmer is that with the spacer attached the hair gets crammed down in between the attachment and trimmer body, making it messy to clean out.

Highly Recommended!

6033,5,"01 5, 2016",A1KHU669CBQ95Y,B00WQAMC8U,"at first i saw this and of course kind of made a face, every ones doing the rose hip seed oil but which quality is the better of them all was my question and why, which one was raw in its form and which one had this distinct smell of roses held to long, You see real rose hip seed oil has this almost mildew smell, other companies distill there's so the smell is actually gone, and over filter it, i have noticed two things when you do this.

1. it removes some of the actual properties used for healing hair and skin
2. it does change the original colour and scent

However this does not mean that it does not work, it does just not at the highest you would expect, it would take a lot more to do a little bit than less to do more which is what we are looking for. with that said Elrique Naturals has figured it out again.

Pros:
Healing properties are explained as healing skin and face blemishes, great for a skin cleanser for those with psoriasis like myself, excema, as well as blemishes to the skin from acne.

haircare when used on wet hair it gives a glossy sheen to it, remember a little goes a long way.

After shower treatment to keep your skin looking and feeling healthy all day.

great to mix in shea butter for a lip treatment or balm for every day use specially in the winter.

conditioning treatment added with an array of other oils (coconut, shea, jojoba, castor) can make this oil the perfect oil for treating dry and brittle ends or just to liven up your hair with a co wash before your shower, leave it on for at least an hour before you shampoo out.

Plastic brown bottle makes it easier to store and keep in a dark place, i wouldn't suggest a fridge since it will make the oil thicken but if your not worried about that go ahead and do that since it will only prolong the life of your oil.

easy dispense push down top, this top is a good idea, i would have liked one that you could close that a child wouldn't be able to squirt it all over the place, but since i do not have small children in my home, I do not have to worry about such things, i would suggest not keeping this at a level to where a child could eat it as roses in any form are good for the skin not internal organs.

Cons:

the distinct smell may be a huge turn off for some, but remember real organics do have strange smells so please don't let that be a turn off to great benefits. remember as they say nothing good  for you actually smells or tastes good

""Inside Scoop"" is a tea rose pink with a slight blue undertone. The color goes on streak free and doesn't require a basecoat.  I am able to get consistent, non-streak opaque color with one application - second application not needed but does seem to prolong the wear.  The top coat provides protection and shine.  It creates a hard shell which prevents chipping and has a high gloss.

I find this easy to remove and it lasts about 6 days with 2 color coats and one top coat.  I let it dry 3-5 minutes between each color coat and 10 minutes after the top coat.  The results look like what you'd get from a nail salon and lasts the whole week.  The shape of the brush allows for precise application.

Overall, I would recommend this product to a friend.",1501200000,0,0,0,0,1

I love the matte texture and it lasts quite a while without being dry at all, which is surprising for a matte lipstick.  The price on Amazon is outrageously expensive.  Sephora has this item for $24.  The only thing I don't like is that I have to carry a sharpener in my purse.  And having to sharpen it wastes some of the product.  But this is my only complaint.  Sex Machine is a pink with blue undertones and it looks great on those with pink or neutral (like me) undertones.  It is not a bright pink but rather, a soft one.  I have several of these pencils, Bettina (a light nude with a glint of pink), Sex Machine, and Dolce Vita (a soft red).  I wish there were more colors.  The matte texture is not at all drying and it has a creamy feel.  It lasts longer than other lipsticks I have, which is a selling point for me.

At first I was worried that this would weigh down my fine textured hair, but it did not! I was also worried it would make my hair and scalp greasy, but it easily rinses clean with warm water.  Ive used hair products with coconut oil, argan oil, rosehip oil, and shea butter in the past. All these ingredients are very beneficial to the hair and skin, and my skin takes kindly to it! It's great to have a product that combines all of these ingredients, it cuts down on my product load. Like I mentioned above earlier my hair is died unnatural colors (purple blue etc...) and it works well with my hair. I haven't noticed it stripping any color or promoting any fading.

The tools vary from about 4 1/4 to 5 3/16 in. long.  Some are rounded with knurling, some have square sections, and one is flat, but they are all easy to grip and handle.

A couple of the tools are similar, but this is a good assortment.  One extractor has flat rings rather than the ubiquitous spoon or cup tips and I find that they are easier to center on small blemishes because a spoon tip hides the pore.

They are made of stainless steel so that they can be sanitized after use with rubbing alcohol or a mild bleach solution.  They could also be autoclaved.

Professional tools like these make it easy to take care of blemishes with damaging the surrounding skin and causing infection and scarring.  To learn how to use these them, read the instruction pamphlet thats included and watch videos on YouTube submitted by doctors like Vikram Yadav or Sandra Lee.

But I have lately been trying some exquisite brands of beauty products that have shown to be enriching & full of life in regards to care. Overall, some of them haven't worked very well, but other products have surprised me. There has been a European brand that I have recently been trying products from called Pre' de Provence. Honestly, I have been very surprised about how enriching their skin care bath care products have been. Lately, I have recently tried some of their body lotion with a lavender scent & honestly it felt very luxurious. The lotion brings in a better sense of moisture & quality in my chapped skin all over my body. While it does cost more than what you would get in other places, it still does a better job for the money. I would suggest that you do give this lotion a try. It might be small, but carries a lot of beauty in product.

It's almost always too strong or so weak that there's barely any scent. This lavender linen spray is absolutely perfect. A few spritzes freshens up any room. The scent doesn't last longer than a couple of hours, though.  I've also used this on bed linens going into the dryer to give them a boost of scent. There's no staining or spotting from this spray, which I wasn't sure would be the case since it does have a tiny bit of coloring added to it. Items that this is sprayed on dry quickly and without any sticky/tacky residue. I prefer this to aerosol versions personally, though it does cost more.

I went from dry to oily to combination skin. Im tired of putting harsh chemicals on my skin. I recently made to switch to all-natural makeup, and Ive been looking for a brand to switch to all natural skin care. Hence, I was excited when I got to try out the Living Nature line at a discount.

The first thing that attracted me to this product is the fact that its made in New Zealand. I had the pleasure of visiting N Zed a couple years ago, and it was refreshing to see the high standards that the country has on organics the lack of pesticides, hormones and additives seen in meat, and how much fresher and better everything there smelled and tasted. Having been there, I automatically trust the products produced there more than I would anywhere else.

I have tried so many different brands and types of lotions and natural alternatives, I couldn't begin to count them all.  For awhile I was using pure sweet almond oil as a moisturizer, but it's really oily/greasy.  Using natural oils is a nice thought, but not realistic.  It gets all over your clothes and anything you touch, and makes you look shiny.  Not good.  Living Nature's natural body lotion felt great upon application, absorbing completely, leaving my skin feeling soft and smooth.  Previously, my skin would itch by the end of the day and look ashy, but this Natural Body Lotion has resolved those skin problems. I have been using this after washing with Living Nature's Gentle Foaming Cleanser, and love using the two together.

I also have to mention that I really love the natural smell that the products in this line have. It reminds of hiking through Karangahake Gorge and all the plant life you could smell whilst walking next to the raging river: damp, tropical, fresh, exotic.

I love using these products and cant wait to try others made by Living Nature. Highly Recommend!",1467676800,0,0,0,0,1

I already use the LOC (liquid, oil, cream) method to moisture my hair after washing, so this is perfect. I use the water that is left on my hair as the ""L,"" then apply this argan oil as the ""O,"" and finally lock it all in with the leave-in conditioner which services as the ""C."" I'm left with very soft, moisturized, and manageable hair.

I love that this leave-in is on the thick side and cream. I love thicker leave-in conditioners because they coat my thick hair better and seem to provide more hydration. The oil is also very thick. This isn't 100% pure argan oil, though, which is why it's thicker. It's a hair treatment and has some other ingredients in it as well. I like the mixture and think it works well on my curly/kinky hair.

I love that I don't have to use a lot of either to saturate my hair. I like to divide my hair into six sections after washing and then go through each section applying the oil and then the leave-in conditioner. It works best on damp hair and gives me some added shine too! I don't have any frizz once my hair is dry since argan oil is amazing at eliminating frizz.

Coffee body scrubs are quite popular now, and this brand ups the ante with a dash of cardamom. The slight camphor of the spice blends with the coffee in this skin product as nicely as it does in the beverage.
Gentle exfoliation is provided not only by the raw sugar, but also the coffee. Many people use coffee scrubs in conjunction with a weight loss program, claiming that the coffee helps tighten and tone skin. Personally, I think toning has more to do with fitness and diet, but this does make skin feel amazingly soft and smooth. It has even been great on hands and feet as well as other parts of the body.
Just be careful in the tub as it can make surfaces slippery after rinsing it off.

Toward this goal I had been using&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nexxus-Humectress-Conditioner/dp/B0007NIRUU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nexxus Humectress Conditioner</a>&nbsp;for decades, but they changed the formula and now it is terrible.

I came across Biolage Fortetherapie Strengthening Conditioner while searching for a good replacement for my old-formula&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nexxus-Humectress/dp/B0007NIRUU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nexxus Humectress</a>&nbsp;conditioner and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nexxus-Youth-Renewal-Rejuvenating-Shampoo/dp/B00AE07FUE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Shampoo</a>&nbsp;(which had a scent I didn't like and led to a strange incident covered in that review).  I replaced the shampoo with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Matrix-Biolage-Strengthening-Shampoo/dp/B003V2P32Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Matrix Biolage Strengthening Shampoo</a>&nbsp;which seems a set with Fortetherapie conditioner.

I've tried several other conditioners that were not really satisfactory and some just not acceptable.  Fortetherapie was like a breath of fresh air and left my hair feeling very nice. The scent is very mild and sort of like bamboo. It is almost no scent which pleases me.

With my below shoulder hair I used dollop about between the size of a nickel and a quarter then rub my hands together and work it throughout my hair. This amount seems to work well and helps make it easier to get my shower comb through my wet hair. It's not really a detangling conditioner for me, but it helps a lot and that is plenty good for me.

Rinsing it out takes longer than I expected. Hotter water helps clear it faster but too-hot may not be good for hair or scalp. I'm slowly trying to use less and less till I hit the right balance.

The bottom line is using&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Matrix-Biolage-Strengthening-Shampoo/dp/B003V2P32Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Matrix Biolage Strengthening Shampoo</a>&nbsp;and Fortetherapie Strenthening conditioner is leaving my hair and scalp feeling and looking better than I expected. My hair looks and feels clean longer and is very manageable.

I'll update the review with observations about the ""strengthening"" properties as I live with Fortetherapie conditioner longer.

First impressions are very positive and hopeful. I hope this will be helpful, especially for those of us who loved the original formula Nexxus Humectress conditioner.

Update: Jan 9 2014
Because of the rinsing issue I mentioned in the main review I have been using less and less of the Biolage conditioner each shampoo. I'm now using about half what I started with and it rinses easier and my hair looks and feels at least as nice.

What I'm using now seems less than what I would have thought would be effective. But happy surprise: it's like getting twice as many shampoos for the same money. It seems like my Biolage conditioner keeps getting better and better.

Update: Feb 15 2015

I think I'm using a little less than in the January update. A little less than a rounded nickel sized blob. This seems about right for my below shoulder length hair. I also can risse this amount more easily without resorting to very hot water. After a couple of months I feel my hair is either stronger or less likely to tangle and break. Whatever the case I got the same positive result.

Matrix Biolage Strengthening conditioner exceeds my original expectation even more now.",1388534400,0,0,0,0,1

Two months ago, I switched back to the old manual razor.  I was surprised at how expensive blades had become, and how much slower a razor shave is. Especially shaving around the throat.  I then saw this on the lightning deal, and was curious how a wet shaver would work.  I gave it a try.  The shave is very comfortable, and very close.  It really matches the razor blade shave, but is much more comfortable.  I only gave it 4 stars, because the conditioner that is automatically loaded into the razor during the charge, doesn't last long at all.  One reviewer wrote that he uses regular shave gel. I have a lot of very old cans  of Gillette foamy Gel.  I used that as if I was using a razor.  It works great.  Just rinse it off the shaver during shaving and after you finish, while the power is on. Since this shaver is made to use in the shower, using regular shave cream and rinsing the shaver doesn't cause any problem.  Given the price of razor blades, it won't bother me to spend $30 for replacement blades when needed.  I love this shaver, and feel badly that I couldn't give it 5 stars.

Most of the products on the market sound good, but when you actually use them consistently, they have major flaws, like not absorbing, causing breakouts or they can't be worn with makeup.

This is by no means solid coca butter. It has *some* cocoa butter in it but it's a ways down the ingredients list. It is more mineral oil,  petroleum. and paraffin which are the first three ingredients. It is very solid, like a candle. In fact, I dumped the tub over accidentally and the whole thing fell out of the tub in one solid piece. I picked it up and put it back in. It looks like a candle, yellow and nearly opaque. It is very greasy and very, very hard. You can't dip your finger into the tub and scoop some out. You have to sort of scrape the sides to get some of the waxy stuff out of there.

On my skin, it is greasy. It has a great scent though I must say. I guess it's cocoa buttery. The fragrance is artificial. I bought this cream for my hands as they are really dry in the winter but this is way too greasy for use anytime but at night with gloves on. It does remove makeup on my face decently although it is certainly not my preferred method. It's not bad on my lips but has a strange taste. I am desperately trying to find a use for this stuff. I think that the description should be much clearer because this simply is NOT cocoa butter at all. It is misleading to label it that way. I have been using this Queen Helene .. stuff on my hands at night and also have used it to remove makeup, on my lips, and also around my eyes for a jolt of hydration but really, I don't know quite what to do with it.

The floating heads on the Norelco 1090 electric shaver really do a good job of conforming to the curves of my face. It takes me about five minutes to shave according to the built in timer on the handle. The shave is much more uniform than that of the Braun 3615 that I have been using for the past few years. However, the shave is not as close. Before the Braun, I used a Norelco 5801. This model is a big improvement over the old Norelco which was slow and not very close at all.. The trade-off with respect to the Braun is one of a closer shave using the Braun vs. a more uniform shave with the new Norelco.

Maintenance:
The clippings are collected in pockets under the shaving heads, This is an advantage in that the clippings are not scattered over the bathroom sink as they are with some electric razors. The pockets have to be cleaned out every shave or two. This is not a big problem. It only takes a few seconds. The manual indicates that the RQ10 shaving head assembly must be replaced every year. Amazon offers the RQ10 for $35. By contrast the Braun cutter and foil assembly which lasts for about one year sells on Amazon for around $24.

Environment:
The first thing that you notice about the Norelco razor is the packaging. The outside layer is a cardboard box that is laminated with metal foil and plastic. There is no way that this can be recycled. Inside the laminated cardboard box is a PET clear plastic enclosure. This enclosure has an outside layer and an internal division. It is thinner than most of this type of packaging so you can cut it open. The PET plastic is type 1 and may be recycled. I think that Philips could come up with a packaging scheme that is more efficient. On the other hand, having a battery minutes-remaining indicator in the razor means that you do not have to keep it plugged in all the time, so that it may drain less electricity than other rechargeable appliances do.",1197244800,0,0,0,1,0

Then, after my previous dentist did 2 crowns that left extra tight ledges that would catch the floss, flossing became a nightmare as the dentotape would often get stuck and become impossible or a tug of war to pull out.  So, DESPITE THE WAXING MAKING IT SOMETIMES GLIDE TOO EASILY OR HARDER TO HANG ON TO, I'M INFINITELY GRATEFUL FOR GLIDE as at least I can now floss easily without dread or needing to deal with the problems that stuck or shredded floss can cause.  As there have been times where I was forced to go to the dentist to remove the stuck piece of floss + given worse problems with all the other types of floss many dentists & hygienists have had me try, it's worth the inconvenience of the slightly slippery Glide to have an easy to use, non-shredding option until a better solution emerges for tight teeth.

I love Essie nail polish, I have a nice size collection of the regular polish. I also love gel nail polish - I have my own tools (LED light).

Standard nail polish never lasts more than 24 hours on my fingernail no matter what I do. Therefore I was excited to try the 2 step polish that requires no LED light but resembles Gel Polish and a hopes for a 14 day wear.

I did two test runs:

Test 1:
Did no nail prep -I just followed directions, two coats of color, one coat of top.  Dries quickly, leaves great gloss

Day 1: Looks great
Day 2: Very small chipping to start on dominate hand
Day 3: Removed: Chipping on 85% of nails

Test 2:
I removed all the polish and prep my nails this time just as I would with doing real GELs. (Push back cuticle, buff nail to remove shine, cleans, add dehydrator, two coats color, one coat of top.

Day 1-2: Looks great, the shine lasted
Day 3: Chipping starting on dominate hand
Day 4: Removed

Granted, I did get a longer wear out of this polish than I have my typical Essie nail polish (or any brand for that matter).  I just have a naturally oil nail bed, but doing some of the prep-work I was able to get one more extra day of the polish.  So this is defiantly an improvement!

I used to be known for having a big, bright smile, but my smiles had grown smaller as my teeth had gotten duller and duller. What a difference the Crest + Oral-B Professional Whitening Kit has made in my appearance. Since I now feel like smiling more, I am getting more smiles in return, and that's a great feeling. With the cleaning power of the Oral-B Healthy Clean + Pro White Precision 4000 electronic toothbrush, there's no excuse not to have a great smile and healthier teeth and gums. The brush offers 4 cleaning modes: Daily, Deep Clean, Sensitive, and Whitening. There's a sensor to let you know if you are brushing too hard, and a timer to let you know when to move to a different section of your mouth. A fully-charged brush should offer up to 10 days of cleaning before it needs a recharge. The Crest 3D White Luxe toothpaste makes your teeth feel so smooth and sparkly-white, and it does contain fluoride. The Crest 3D White ""Glamorous White"" Multi-Care Whitening Rinse is alcohol free--YES! It whitens teeth, protects against stains, kills bad-breath germs, and it leaves your mouth feeling minty-fresh. The combination of the awesome electronic brush, the dynamic toothpaste, and the dazzling mouth rinse is a total win-win situation for your smile, your breath, and your personal confidence. The bonus of the 3D White Whitestrips with Advanced Seal, ""Professional Supreme"", is the gold star on top of the tree. After using the brush, the toothpaste, and the rinse, I was feeling pretty good and seeing great results. However, when I tried the strips for just a few days, they amped up the wattage on my smile! I had never used whitening strips before, but these strips were easy and pleasant to use, and they work fast! So now, I have a whiter, brighter, more appealing smile, and my personal confidence has taken a great leap forward. I am encouraged to do more to take care of myself, and to not stop trying to reach out for the brass ring.

~PROS~
- Adjustable neck strap (works on me and my 7 year-old son)
- Good size at 36"" x 54""
- Repels water
- Appears to be well made

~CONS~
I would prefer a snap closure versus the velcro which tends to hold hair - a minor gripe though.

5506,4,"04 15, 2016",AJ9ZYMEUY14AX,B00O1DY34G,"This fun cheetah style detangling brush does the job of detangling without pain in a little bit longer than a regular brush.

Firstly, this brush is slightly smaller than a standard paddle brush. It has bristles both small and long that are plastic and have a flat head. The brush handle is about 3-4 inches and easy to hold. The wording on the bristle side of the brush rubbed off after one use, but the color on the back of the brush (the cheetah print pattern) stays put.

When brushing through the hair, there is absolutely zero pain to the noggin even through tangles. I am able to use this on my one-year-old with curly hair to the middle of her back. I have straight hair all the way down to my hips that gets tangled like no other. This brush glides through tangles after a few repeated swipes with no pain whatsoever. There is no pulling feeling on the hair. The only hair that falls out is the hair that was naturally about to shed. It reduces my hair loss when compared to a regular brush by about 3/4!

The only negative to this brush is that it takes about 2-3x the standard amount of time I use to take using my other brush.  I need to repeatedly swipe certain areas to get out the tangles. In comparison, although my standard brush would take less time, it would be painful and make me lose more hair.

These are strips that are applied for 10-minutes and, as expected you need strips for each side, but the overall reduction of sensitivity is nothing short of amazing. I can now enjoy ice cream without cringing if the cold strays on one of my bad teeth.

7614,5,"12 19, 2013",A35LT14WG5BX0T,B00CZH3K1C,"I've been a loyal Philips Sonicare user (my current model being the Sonicare Flexcare) for many years. Sonicare brushes work by emitting a sonic vibration that vibrates the bristles quickly, cleaning your teeth far more effectively than a manual toothbrush. The difference is like night and day.

My biggest gripe with my Sonicare is that sometimes it doesn't clean as effectively as I'd like right up by my gum line. I was intrigued by the rotating head on Oral B's brush, thinking that perhaps the rotating action would do a better job at cleaning these areas. I really had high hopes for this toothbrush and was excited to give it a try.

This kit includes a precision 5000 toothbrush with charger, optional brush head storage area with lid (that can be easily connected/removed to the charging base), four different brush heads, a SmartGuide device and a travel/storage case for the toothbrush. According to the manual this brush will hold a charge through 20 uses (twice per day for 10 days) so for shorter trips there's no need to bring the charger along.

My first impression of this brush is that it's heavier and more stout than my Sonicare. This isn't a complaint necessarily, just an observation. The toothbrush sets nicely on the charging base and charges with no exposed metal parts. For an item that is constantly getting wet this is a great feature.

The rotating action did actually do a better job at thoroughly cleaning my teeth than my Sonicare. Because of this action, however, the toothbrush vibrates a LOT more than my Sonicare and the vibrations are more rough. This is something that I'm getting used to though. Like my Sonicare, the toothbrush pauses and beeps when it's time to move to a new area of your mouth which is a great feature.

The SmartGuide device is really neat. It actually communicates with the toothbrush and tells you if you're pressing too hard. It also displays the quadrants of your mouth and helps guide you to which quadrant you should be brushing during each interval. Since I've been using an electric toothbrush for so many years already I don't see myself using this device very often. The toothbrush operates just fine without using the SmartGuide device which I personally appreciate.

My biggest complaint about this brush is that the shafts of the brush heads have openings in them. I'm not sure why this is but these openings allow liquefied toothpaste and whatnot to escape your mouth while brushing and it can end up on your toothbrush and/or hand. Gross. I'm sure this is one of those issues that will remedy itself as I get used to this brush but thought it was worth mentioning. My Sonicare brush has no such openings on the brush heads so I wasn't expecting this.

The items included in this kit (small bottle of mouthwash, toothpaste, and dental floss) are nice for sampling these products but don't really add much value to this kit. The bag it all came in made for a nice presentation of the product but fails to serve any purpose as soon as you unpack its contents for use. The bag is a reusable tote style bag and having one in this size has actually come in handy for other things though.

Overall I wouldn't say the kit with the small extras is worth the additional expense but the toothbrush itself is definitely worth it. Great product!",1387411200,0,0,0,0,1

1728,5,"07 17, 2008",A13700AF4X40YG,B000UK2VRK,"For years I had been looking for an electric razor that would come close to being as good as a blade for shaving with no luck. About a year ago, my wife got me the Norelco Arcitec razor. This high end (and expensive) razor finally got me to switch. Now along comes the Cool Skin 8040X (at half the price).

The fact that it is a wet system intrigued me. It uses Nivea shaving conditioner, which is injected into the back of the razor.  A nice no mess system ... a spout on the conditioner bottle fits in the razor and injects the conditioner.  When shaving, you press a button and a few drops of gel comes up through the heads.  You wet your skin, press the button, and shave.  I found that I press the button about 8 times during shaving. This means I end up refilling the razor about once or twice a week (no big deal... take less than a minute). The razor also has a nice rubber grip that makes it easy to hold when its wet.

The razor comes with the charger, a cloth pouch, a sideburn trimmer attachment, head cover, and a trial size can of conditioner.

The charger is your standard wall unit that plugs into a plastic base. The razor sits in the base. Takes about 4 hours to completely charge. A green light in the handle  flashes while charging and stays lit when fully charged. You should not leave it plugged in all of the time.  When the razor needs to be charged, a red light comes on. While this is not as nice as the Arcitec's LED that shows the remaining time left on the battery, this razor is smaller (and a lot less expensive) and there probably isn't room for the display.

The pouch is a soft cloth and really doesn't offer much protection. I don't use it.

The sideburn trimmer is not built in to the razor.  Instead, you pop off the blade assembly and snap this in it's place. I thought this would be a pain but its not. But even if it was, it would be worth it. It's so much better than the one built into the Arcitec.  It's bigger and cuts better. By being bigger, the blades are further away from the body of the razor and easy to manipulate.

The head cover is a plastic cover to protect the blades; useful for traveling.

The conditioner goes along way (still some left after 2 weeks of use and this is a tiny can).

The most important thing is the shave. As I said before, the Arcitec made me switch from blades.  This made me give up my beloved Arcitec. It really does shave as close as the Trac blades and shaving gel system I love to use.",1216252800,0,0,0,0,1

I received the ""agrumes"" scent, which is citrus in English, and I've used it for several days now.  It has a light scent of maybe citronella or lemon balm, which is very fresh and clean smelling.  The bar itself is huge (8.8 ounces) and rectangular, not like the rounded, concave, 3 ounce bar soaps we find at the store!  It lathers up quickly and produces a thick foamy lather that cleans well.  It also contains shea butter for moisturizing, although it rinses cleanly without any oily residue.

The bars are ""quad milled"" (processed four times) which makes them slow to dissolve, so one bar will last for several months with daily use.  I especially like that this soap doesn't contain parabens or sodium lauryl sulphate, both of which are linked to health issues.  I've made soap myself several times and know that soap doesn't have to have tons of chemicals to work well.

4406,5,"09 4, 2010",A26BPNWY3HKNYR,B001U1YTDC,"Lets see, where to begin. I live in Florida where we need sunscreen year round, especially if your outdoors a lot. Aside from working I ride my mountain bike 100-200 miles per week (combination of trail and road, needless to say suncreen is important. This year I think I have tried every sunscreen on the market, literetly. All neutorgena products eventually made my eyes swell and constant water, aveeno did the same, as did olay, and every other brand on the shelf. One day I purchased Blue Lizard sensitive skin , as I thought it was a pretty safe product, and it is. However, I apply sunscreen every 2 hours when I am in the sun (as suggested) and the blue lizard seemed to get pretty greasy, to the point that I was taking a paper towel and pat my entire face to try and soak some of it up. Fallene products went on smoothly but dried my face out, as did the blue lizzard. Vanicream was nice, but greasy as well.  I began to try products like badger and beyond coastal when I accidentlly came across the EWG website listing the 2010 best/safest sunscreen products.
At the very top is sweetsation products. ALthough more money on intial cost, you actually are spending less because you need less. The products ingredients are all truly organic and that is why EWG name it top sunscreen/moisteruizer (spelling error).

The SPF 50 is easier to spread than the SPF30. The product blends in immedietly, does not make your face feel greasy, and last along time (even for me riding 2-3 hours in 90 degree weather). I have not felt any stinging in my eyes or flushing on my skin. Absolutely no effects like every other sunscreen on the market has given me. I am not someone who likes strong frangrances, and this product does not have that at all.
At first, it will leave a white cast, but if you gently rub it in and wait a few minutes the ghostly look goes away. The slightly white cast is worth the quality of the product.

When I first bought the SPF 30 I was thrown off a bit applying it, as it seemed to clump up on my face. The clumps would go away once I was able to rub them in, but had to wait a few minutes. My face immedietly had this new glow to it, I truly had not seen my face look this fresh in years (33 years old now). I am not pregant, but since I ride my bike so much in the sun I have become concerned about my health and the safety of the products I use. Sweetsation products are the safest and do wonders for your skin. I find my face to have this fresh look, like a healthy glow. I have noticed friends looking at me, one friend told me how healthy my face looked. She commented as soon as she saw me that morning. I didn't even mention to her anything about applying anything.

Anyway, I really liked the SPF 30 and didn't want to return so I emailed the company at the sweetsation therapy website directly, on a Saturday evening a couple of weeks ago actually. Too my surpise, about an hour later my phone had an incoming email, and it was from the owner of Sweetsation Therapy. Her email response was very impressive, how many businesses will email their clients on the weekends? not many. She gave me very helpful tips; suggested only apply a pea size or less at a time or putting a serum or day cream on first. This worked very well (the pea size amount) and no clumping at all. I was truly impressed with the cutsomer service. Since that Saturday (1-2 weeks ago) I have asked the owner a few more questions and she has always responded, never missed a question.

Sweetsation products are truly great. Even if your not in the sun everyday, the products are worth every penny. They last a very long time, longer than over the counter products and most others.",1283558400,0,0,0,0,1

You can always tell hand-made soaps by their slightly irregular shape.  What I like most about this soap is its scent.  The scent combination is unique and subtle.

I got three different scents Zesty Lemon soap, Grapefruit and Calendula soap, Lavender and Lemongrass soap.  The scents are definitely recognizable, but they are not strong and do not linger on my hands.

My three soap bars are sized 3.5""W x 2""L x 1""H. Each soap weighs 4.2 oz.  The soap is a plain brick but inside of each soap there are specs of mix ins.

I like that it is all natural, no parabens, no artificial dyes, no artificial fragrances.

I received this soaps for evaluation and review as part of a new product introduction. I loved all the soaps, if I had to pick my favorite is Lavendar and Lemongrass, Lavender is a dominant scent but in this soap I can definitely smell lemongrass which makes for a very nice combination.

All Essie's are great.  I wear them almost exclusively as they are almost the only thing that wears above a day on my crazy nails.  I can typically get about a week with any Essie (and I can go beyond that with their gel couture).  I do reapply top coat every 2nd or third day.

The Gel Couture polishes are a thicker more gelly like formula than the ""regular"" Essies.  They I also have a wider brush, but it's so nicely tapered that it's easy to work with.  I would recommend the ""Regular"" Essies if you want to do nail art, but for regular one-color wear, either formula is nice.  The Gel Couture line does wear a little longer, but I'm typically ready to change colors before I reach their maximum wear time.

One of my favorite aspects of Essie is that its very forgiving if you happen to be prone to messing up your nails.  They dry quickly once the top coat is on (the color is a little more vulnerable to marring before the  top coat is applied), and as they dry they self-level to give you a smooth glassy surface even if your technique (like mine) is imperfect.

The Gel Couture line really requires the matching top coat to get its wear time, but I use that top coat over other Essies quite often as well.

My Essie collection is approaching 100 bottles and my obsession shows no signs of abating.  I did receive this bottle free to review, however I routinely purchase these polishes with my own money.  This is one of several reds I own, and it's one of my favorites.",1506384000,0,0,0,0,1

(Apparently some of my Pre De Provence products are showing up in one review - so while this reveiw is for bath salts, I have the lavender lotion as well, which I do love the scent of it but as with the bath salts, wish the bottle were nicer).

There was no seal on the top of the jar, just the lid. That's fine, but I would wonder how long it would sit on a shelf before purchasing and how ""fresh"" the scent would last. That said, when I opened the lid and took a whiff, it was pretty powerfully scented. I like the lavender aspect but there's another scent there that I don't like and can't figure out what it is. It's off-putting. It doesn't linger in the water, so that's good.

I sprinkled some in my bathroom sink that I'd filled with warm water. The water turned a slight lavender shade as the bath salts turned clear. The salt crystals did melt pretty quickly, though as with any bath salts I've used there are always a few that are stubborn.

The water felt soft enough, I suppose-nothing really special, but that strong scent wasn't as apparent in the diluted water.

I did think it a bit pricey at just under $17 (at time of this review). For that price, I'd like a glass bottle or something prettier in the jar design itself, though the lavender-colored crystals do look pretty. Still, there are plenty of bath salts out there that are half the price and smell about the same, so what would make me want to purchase this one exclusively? Something that made it attractive to me, and that would be a pretty bottle/jar that I could display in my bathroom in my basket of bath goodies. Or, to give someone as a gift.

This plastic jar makes it seem like one of those cheaper jars of bath salts you can buy at Big Lots, which I can do for less than half the price if I want bath salts. Pretty it up some so I feel I'm getting my money's worth. You cold say Pre De Provence has quality ingredients and maybe that's why the price, but I'm not finding it special enough to pay almost $17.",1504137600,0,0,1,0,0

I work a high stress job and this supplement definitely helps. The company also provides a money back guarantee if you are not pleased. St. John's Wort can interact with some medications especially BIRTH CONTROL PILLS...so research before using. This company, Les Labs, produces this in the United States, which is always a plus. I have taken St. John's Wort for years just to help even out my mood and it has always worked well for me. This is a very good product and I would highly recommend trying it.

5592,4,"05 8, 2015",A1QBOC76MIOJYP,B00QHX7NT0,"I love all the Bliss Fatgirlslim products I have ever bought or tried. Fatgirlsleep is by far my fave product of the line and one of my most favorite body products, period - it is the best. This product here, Hide and Glow Sleek is ok. As a self tanner, it is a great product. it goes on surprisingly even, dries super fast and has no scent at all that I could smell. It reminds me of a light airbrush spray, so it is very easy to work with and get nice, even color. I am very pale and I got the medium to deep shade and it does not look orange at all. I am sure if you spray it too heavily, too quickly, it might, but I ended up with  very nice color and not very dark at all - I didn't want anything too drastic. It gave me just the right amount of color to take away the paleness. I love self  tanning products since I am so fair skinned, but it is hard to find many that work well and not look fake or orange or too dark. It takes me awhile to build up a natural tan, so I always start the season with self tanners. As just a tanner, I like this one since the color is nice, even, and you don't even have to use your hands to apply it. You could just spray and go.

The directions state to spray even strokes down the leg, but I didn't really go in straight lines like that. It is a very fine spray, so it applies very nicely and lightly, so you can build up the color if you want. Once I spray an area, I kinda give it a once over with my hand to smooth and/or blend it and it already feels dry and doesn't even need any blending. It has a very faint shimmer to it, which is what helps the ""sleek"" effect. The light reflects off those particles and helps to hide imperfections - like an optical illusion. I am not one for shimmery or glittery body products, but this is very minimal and I don't mind it at all.

As for the firming aspect, I don't think it is as good as the original Fatgirlslim cream or Fatgirlsleep (sleep version is fabulous, im telling you!) but it does make your skin feel smooth. I don't think it has the tightening effect that the creams do. It may be hard to deliver in a spray like this, especially if you use it lightly. Overall, though, I do like it and I will continue to use it. If I notice any further tightening effects as more time passes, I will update my review. With the Bliss creams, it is immediate so I expected the same with this spray.

As a tanner, I'd give it 5 stars
As a slimming/tightening/firming product, I'd give it 3 to 4-ish stars so far. The effects of the shimmer reducing the appearance of cellulite and dimples allows for the rating to be closer to 4 stars.

If you really want to feel your skin tighter and lose the appearance of dimples, try Fatgirlslim or Fatgirlsleep. Your skin will say thank you!!",1431043200,0,0,0,1,0
5798,4,"09 29, 2017",AT53ZTTO707MB,B00W259T7G,"I have another brand of bar soap with a much more potent patchouli fragrance.  I had hoped that I would be able to bury my nose in this bar from Pre de Provence and imagine that I had just opened a bottle of patchouli essential oil.  No, no, it did not happen.  While it is a lovely fragrance, it is somewhat meek and mild.  Maybe that is what you are looking for, but I wanted deep, true, powerful patchouli.

With this bar from Pre de Provence I do get rich, smoothing and soothing moisturizing.  It was opportune that I had recently purchased two bars of soap from Plantlife, patchouli and sandalwood.  Oh, my!  Those fragrances are potent and wonderful!  Way more so than those from Pre de Provence.  Having the two patchouli bars at the same time allowed me to see the moisturizing qualities of both soaps.  The Plantlife dried my skin.  This Pre de Provence always left my skin soft and supple.  It was a BIG difference; so easy to see when I had the two together.

So, when it comes to the patchouli and the sandalwood soaps, which one you would like better depends on what you are looking for in a soap:  True potent fragrance or moisturizing luxury.  For me it boils down to my skin's needs in the cooler, drier months, and that means I go with the Pre de Provence.

If you do want to try the Plantlife patchouli, this is it:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Patchouli-100-Pure-amp-Natural-Aromatherapy-Herbal-Soap-4-oz-113g/dp/B000146LKS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Patchouli 100% Pure & Natural Aromatherapy Herbal Soap- 4 oz (113g)</a>.  Maybe you might be interested in an Italian bar soap put out by Pre de Provence.

A word on the size of this bar:  I have long fingers, so this large 250g size is not awkward in my hand.  But I can easily see that it might be a problem for smaller hands.

Tom's is a small company, employing fewer than two hundred people.  It was founded in 1970 and then purchased by Colgate in 2006.  Fortunately, Colgate has left Tom's alone to manage their business according to their original principles.

Tom's makes natural products.  The toothpaste contains no sugar, sweeteners, or artificial flavoring.  By contrast, I looked at a tube of Colgate toothpaste that I have on the shelf.  It contains ""flavor,"" whatever that is, ""saccharine,"" and ""propylene glycol.""  The last ingredient is a less-toxic form of anti-freeze.

Moreover, unlike the hippies of the sixties, the Beatnik generation from whence Cassady came actually shaved!).

I am very pale, and have auburn/reddish hair. This color SHOULD in theory look pretty spiffy on me, but I can't get past the fact that it looks like a GLITTERBOMB exploded on my face. What the ..>?!?!?!?!? And easy to overdo? Yes indeed! This blush is very very silky and soft; use a light hand. You can always add more but woe be to anyone who overapplies it. You'll look like a feverish clown!

For us (ahem) older ladies, try the Deep Throat. Pretty much the same color, without the glitty garbage all over every pore on your face!

UPDATE: I have the Orgasm/Laguna duo (reviews and photos and comparisons to other products coming soon) and it has been sitting ever since my horrifying discovery out in daylight, that there were glitter bits on my face from using the Orgasm blush. I have since discovered---your brush makes a LOT of difference. I switched to a very fluffy Real Techniques brush instead of my usual blush brush; it deposited gentle color and the glitter was very iffy. (As in, you couldn't really see obvious glitter but if you were verycloselikethis you could see tiny bits) I have revised my review a little bit. Still giving the advice that it's easy to overapply and, this color is sure not for everyone, but I don't want to shoot it with a silver bullet any more. If your skin has any tendency towards redness at all, I implore you to do a test run with this before you count on it looking good for any important (or public) event! I practically have to get microscopic amounts of this on the brush or it's too much for me, and does nothing positive to enhance my complexion.

1536,5,"03 13, 2011",ABLOQZIL42W7I,B000GGFZLC,"As a dentist, I have seen over and over again the destructive results of not flossing one's teeth. The unfortunate result of such neglect is the rapid development of cavities between the teeth (especially in kids), and inevitable gum disease in adults, which can lead to eventual tooth loss.  Gum disease almost always starts in-between the teeth, and the only way to clean the germs that cause gum disease and cavities between the teeth is with floss.  Mechanical scrubbing with floss is the key, and all the daily brushings and rinsings will not remove the in-between stubborn plaque below the gumline and at the contact point of the teeth. The bottom line is that we need to floss our teeth if we want to keep them for a lifetime.

Reach floss is thicker than the average floss. It will be more difficult to pass between teeth, but I like it because I find that it cleans my teeth better than the smaller diameter floss. This is a personal preference not based on any clinical data. Reach floss is not for everyone. Those with tight contacts will have trouble with Reach floss. This floss is waxed (easier to slide between teeth), and is unflavored.

If one's fingers get sore from flossing, there are various floss forks that one can load with this floss.  Using a floss fork is very effective and handy, as one does not have to get fingers in the mouth. Here is a good one I recommend:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flossaid-Dental-Floss-Holder-ONE/dp/B000LC22R6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flossaid Dental Floss Holder **ONE**</a>

Floss each tooth contact with a gentle insertion of the floss between the teeth.  Gently scrub each tooth up and down and make sure to go under the gumline (as this is where gum disease germs get their start).  After flossing, it is a great time to brush.  Always use a fluoridated toothpaste for maximum protection of the teeth (fluoride makes the enamel crystal more resistant to acid destruction).

I leave this shaver in my car because some times I would be in a hurry and forget to shave in the morning before I get to work.  It is a very nicely made shaver.  As much as I don't like buying things that are made in China, this one is not bad because of its Panasonic brand.  I am glad I bought the silver even though it cost nearly double compared to the black one.  I wish it had a charger (hence the 4 stars) but I guess you can always buy AA batteries if you really had an emergency.
The case is nicely polished like a space pod.  It gives a very close shave.
What I also don't like about is the noise.  It is quite loud (compared to my other bigger Norelco.)

I realized that I take care of my face and body skin but I tend to neglect my hands. I tend to use whatever is at hand. I recently had the chance to try this Nourishing Hand Cream by Skinfood.

FIRST IMPRESSION: 

It comes in a simple squeeze tube. The product comes out easily and it is easy to apply. It has a medium and creamy texture. I feels like a whipped cream. It has a natural scent. I can smell the natural scents of the ingredients such as Aloe Vera, Avocado oil and Manuka Honey. It is not very strong. The application is really nice and it leaves the skin refresh, smooth and soft.

PERFORMANCE:

This hand cream stands out from the few other hand creams that I have tried. From the texture to the finish of the cream. Usually the texture of the other creams are light or runny but in this one is more concentrated. A little bit goes a long way and my hands stay hydrated for longer. The finish is not greasy or tacky like other hand creams. The fisnish is smooth and soft. It does not feel or look oily.

I applied the cream to one side of my hands and the other side with another moisturizer. I asked my family to tell me if them could feel a difference. They told me that they prefer the side with the Skinfood - Nourishing Hand Cream.

In addition, I am really glad that this cream contains many natural ingredients that I have used in the past and I love such as Aloe Vera, Avocado Oil and Manuka Honey.

Apply this every morning and night. My hands have been loving the treatment during the cold days and I keep this with me at all times. Since I use it religiously, I have not experience any cracking or dry skin.

SUMMARY
LIKES:

 -  Natural ingredients
 -  Key ingredients: Aloe Vera, Avocado Oil and Manuka Honey
 -  Cruelty Free
 -  It does not contain Parabens
 -  It hydrates the skin
 -  It is not greasy
 -  It smooths and softens the skin

DISLIKES:

 -  It is on the pricey side

This custardy, thick, whipped creme practically vanishes into your skin with a few rubs, leaving a faint silky trace - no oiliness or greasiness -- behaving like a light body lotion in this sense. You can get dressed immediately without ruining your clothes. Incredible softening texture. A pleasure for those who love to lavishly slather on indulgent butters without the 'slip n slide' factor.

The fragrance is very strong. It can double as perfume, and lasts a whole day. At first, i relished the fruity-nutty-toffee gourmand scent. But after an entire day, it got cloying; almost nauseating-- and the strength just can't be dialed down if you applied it all over. But if you love the smell, then, Bravo! you've just saved money not having to buying separate perfume.

The only negative is that, for the high price, it should really contain higher levels of plant-based oils and botanicals. The cupuacu, guarana, acai, cocoa butter and other ""brazilian"" extracts are listed AFTER the fragrance, which shows that they are at minimal levels (possibly single-digit % or less).

While any real faults in any of my experiments are probably due to the recipe itself, this ingredient has reacted as expected and I got to say I've had some great results.  When using this soap on its own, I've been impressed as well.  The almond aroma is not overwhelming, but clean and natural.  I've seen some reviews complaining this doesn't sud well, but I have no complaints there.  It rinses completely as well with no surface residue.

3817,5,"09 16, 2017",A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV,B001LNODUS,"Note: At the time of this review, seven different products are being sold on the same page. I am reviewing the lavendar lavender blossoms.

This is a generous amount of dried (loose) lavender blossoms designed to act in the same fashion as potpourri. The most important aspect to this product is the scent which I found to be delicate and natural. Lavender in general can be fairly overbearing, and you can smell this through the packet as it is relatively potent. However, it is not cloying or suffocating in its potency. I'm guessing this is because it's not as concentrated as a perfume or extract.

When you have the bag open and are exposed to all of it at once, it seems really strong, but as something you place in a location in lesser quantities, it doesn't tend to be so overbearing. I think that it strikes a good balance between being potent enough to have an effect and not being so potent as to make you queasy from a strong scent. I have had a lavender-scented face mask (the sort filled with beans that you heat or cool and apply to your face) for some time and found that putting that mask in a plastic zipper bag with a sachet made from these dried blossoms helped revived the fading scent quite well without have to risk staining the mask or making it smell too strong from using oils or perfume.

If there is any weak point to this, it is the presentation which can be a bit messy. I had to be very careful when opening the package not to spill the small, dried bits. It would have been better if it had come in a resealable package or a jar of some sort given how tiny they are. I decanted mine into a jar both to keep the scent contained in the long run and to more easily manage them. Still, since this point is intrinsic to the type of product this is (tiny dried blossoms), I'm not dinging it for that, but just noting it.",1505520000,0,0,0,0,1

Back in the day when we over did it on plucking our eyebrows and now thick eyebrows are the in so to speak. Not only do they make them grow they keep the gray ones dark. I don't know if that is because of the color of the castor oil or something else in the ingredients. either way you will have your eyebrows and thinning eyelashes growing back and it does work.

For me, that's a 5 star feature.  My husband's only complaint is that it's a little bulky because of this feature and that when he wants to trim around his mustache or ears he can't just pull off the plastic guard like he could with his old Panasonic so the blades are exposed, but has to replace the guard with a smaller head that has exposed blades that made for this purpose.

Some reviewers have complained about the noise but to me it seems about average as far as sound goes.  It doesn't wake me up if the bathroom door is open to the bedroom and I'm still asleep.  Whatever extra noise is probably due to the vacuum feature.  So we'd say that while it's not perfect, it's a pretty good trimmer.",1261353600,0,0,0,1,0

Its a subdued scent of freshly mown grass and it fades as soon as you apply it so it won't interfere with your perfume.  It disperses easily from the pump bottle and feels cool as you apply it under your eyes.  It blends in quickly and leaves no residue so it won't interfere with applying makeup.  Ive had trouble with other eye gels that make my eyes water but not with Beneleaf.

Helps with under eye puffiness but I didn't notice any huge difference in under eye wrinkles though it does smooth them somewhat.  Also the pump puts out more than Id like to use unless Im hyper careful to press lightly.  Its made in the US which gets huge points for me.

The handles are smooth and solid. The bristles are even and pick up the perfect amount of product! I would recommend washing these brushes and allowing to dry for at least 24 hours to make sure they are completely dry prior to use, especially if you plan on throwing them in to a makeup bag afterwards. If they are not completely dry they can harbor more bacteria than usual. I am really happy with my purchase!

Not quite sure how many women that have been attracted to me because of Aqua Velva,  I do know for sure that it's just to many to count. Ha.  Not sure how long this has been around but the Williams Company ran a paper advertisement, taken from a 1949 magazine, which features Ralph Bellamy of Detective Story and Ezio Pinza of South Pacific for Aqua Velva After Shave Lotion. I'm sure you all remember Ralph Bellamy and Ezio Pinza from the 40's right.

There slogan was "" There is nothing like an AQUA VELVA MAN "" and it seemed to work because this was a hot item when I was a young man. It's just amazing that this is still around when the vast majority of after shave lotions from that time period have disappeared over the years.

The only negative about Aqua Velva is it does not last very long. Usually in less than an hour the aroma has dissipated. The more expensive after shave lotions and perfumes have Ambergris in them which is quite expensive and comes from a sperm whale this enables the aroma to linger much longer.

At any rate this is a great classic after shave with a wonderful refreshing odor, give it a try you might just like it.

First of all - the speed of the jet is pretty fast - on a full speed, it can fly close to 8-10' - with that kind of speed - it can actually cause your gums to bleed (atleast mine did) and I had to reduce the speed where it comfortable for me (i keep the 4th/5th speed setting).

1612,5,"06 6, 2009",A2SRVDDDOQ8QJL,B000GLRREU,"I wanted to hold of a while on this review because I know there are several complaints in prior reviews so I wanted to be able to address them.

I think the biggest complaint is that you're going to get wet using this Waterpik.  I think that this complaint is very much overblown.  If you are very concerned about any water getting on the sink it is possible to use the Jet with your lips closed and then press the temporary stop button and release the water from your mouth and then start again with your lips closed.  Personally I think this is silly and I don't mind a small amount of water getting on the sink.  Could Waterpik bend the tip in such a way so that no water would run down on your hand?  Maybe but I think that would also make the unit really awkward to use.

Another complaint is that the Waterpik is not powerful enough.  I'm up to level 6 out of 10 and it has taken me about 3 months to get there.  Even though I now have a lot of experience using the Waterpik there are still times I ""miss"" and hit a soft spot in my mouth and it hurts--even at level 6.  In short, the Waterpik is extremely powerful, IMO, and I've been stuck on level 6 for over 2 weeks (I may not go any higher).  When I turn it up to level 10 and point the stream at the bathtub it is scary strong.  My advice is to start at level 1 and work up very slowly.

I had seen it mentioned that it is too easy to pop off the tip while in use.  This has not happened to me in 3 months of use.  I DO think that the placement of the button for the tip release is unfortunate because you have to be careful not to press it while you're using the Waterpik.

Some have suggested that the reservoir is too small.  In my experience the reservoir is the perfect size for a single use.  I always find that by the time I've done my whole mouth the unit runs out of water.

I have seen suggestions that there are leaks.  I want to make a very careful note here that the way the unit is designed you have to push down firmly on the reservoir once you drop it into the unit.  There is a rubber valve that has to make good contact in order to form a seal.  It isn't necessarily obvious that you need to do this just by looking at the unit (but it is in the directions).

Finally I'd just like to add a couple of my own observations.

The ""footprint"" of this unit is very small.  I really was happy about that because I have a tiny bathroom sink and i was wondering where I would put it.

Also, a waterpick is a really important part of dental hygiene and I think everyone should consider using it.  I don't personally think it replaces flossing but it makes your flossing much more effective (I generally use the Waterpik after flossing and before brushing).

If there are any questions just leave me a comment!

Edit: Long term follow-up.  The unit still works but the temporary stop button sticks now every time I use it.  To unstick it I have to turn off the unit and then tap the handle until it unsticks.

Final follow-up 9/15/11:  The unit finally stopped working altogether.  I'm not upset about it.  I can see by my order date that this pik lasted about 2 years.  Also, I think it says something that just today I ordered the exact same model.",1244246400,0,0,0,0,1

5828,4,"09 16, 2017",A1J5HIF41ENSMZ,B00W259T7G,"This review is for the Olive Oil bar.

I almost didn't use this soap at first because of the scent.  I didn't find it pleasant at all.  Saying that it smelled like vomit would be an exaggeration, but that's honestly the first word that popped into my mind when I smelled it.  I am more used to sweeter smelling soaps, and the Olive Oil version has no sweetness to it at all.  After about a week, I've gotten more used to it, but I won't be ordering any more in this scent.

As for how it works/feels, I think it's really great.  I use it in the shower with a washcloth, and it applies easily and seems to wash off well.  Some bar soaps require quite a bit of rubbing on a washcloth to get a good lather going, but this one lathers up pretty quickly.  After showering and toweling off, my skin just feels good.  I usually use Suave body wash (have for years), and I really like it, but my skin just feels different...better...when using this soap.  I don't know why, but I know it does.

Like some other moisturizing soaps that I've tried, this one quickly develops a thick layer on the outside (mostly on the lower side against the soap dish) of what I'm guessing is the moisturizer.  The Olive Oil bar is green, and that layer is mostly white.  I don't really like rubbing that white layer on me or the washcloth, so I tend to rinse it off first.  I admit that's out of ignorance and perhaps the exact opposite of what I should do.

I really like how my skin feels after using this, so I might try some of the other scents.  I recommend the soap in general, but I really don't recommend the Olive Oil version.",1505520000,0,0,0,1,0

I also use a flouride gel once a week that is prescription only from my dentist.

This comes with six attachments, including one for cleaning the tongue, and one for getting into gum pockets.  There probably isn't anything better to use at home than this for the health of the gums.  It can get slightly under the edge of the gums with the tiny gum attachment to spray out the debris.  It gets things floss misses, but I still use floss also.  I like the pause button on the handle to pause the water jet if needed.

It's petroleum-free, paraben-free, cruelty-free, and contains no animal products.  Dare to be Bare Shave Cream softens your hair, conditions the skin, and protects it from razor burn and skin bumps.  Dare to be Bare also has a pleasant, but neutral scent, so it can be used by both women and men.  It leaves no scent behind on your skin.

Just a pump or two of Dare to be Bare rubbed onto your legs and you're ready to shave.  Using firm (not hard), long, and even strokes, work you way up your leg.  Shave all the way around your legs, checking with your hand to make sure you didn't miss a spot.  Once you get to your knee, make sure it has some Dare to be Bare on it.  Step your foot on to the side of the tub so that you knee is bent.  This tightens the skin of your knee making it harder to cut yourself.

The large blunt nosed tweezers will grip and pluck a very fine hair/splinter/whatever. The curved shears are very sharp and sturdy and will clip anything you need clipped.

When I saw this lip color from ELF, I decided to try it. It was so inexpressive I had nothing to lose really. I bought the shade Praline not really knowing exactly what color it was. On my lips, it is a light cinnamony shade with a bit of brown. It's subtle. I have rosy lips and this tones the red down and makes my lips look more neutral.

The stick is pointy so you can line your lips first then fill them in. On the other side of the stick is a build in sharpener. I really like that. The color is  creamy without being overly so. It is not a true matte and it doesn't wear like one. It will wear off after a few hours especially if I eat or drink. It does transfer onto glasses and things so it definitely is not like my matte lipglosses. But I like the subtle color and the price as well. I don't mind reapplying the color. My lips look less dry and wrinkly than they do with liquid matte gloss so it's a nice change. It's a long wearing lip pencil. Well, longer wearing that bullet lipsticks anyway.

For the low price I am going with 4 stars. if I paid $20 for this, I would go with 3 because it does transfer and wears off  But the price can't be beat and it feels nice on my lips. Not too heavy and not too dry.",1520208000,0,0,0,1,0

4971,5,"06 6, 2009",A2SRVDDDOQ8QJL,B000FOI48G,"I wanted to hold of a while on this review because I know there are several complaints in prior reviews so I wanted to be able to address them.

I think the biggest complaint is that you're going to get wet using this Waterpik.  I think that this complaint is very much overblown.  If you are very concerned about any water getting on the sink it is possible to use the Jet with your lips closed and then press the temporary stop button and release the water from your mouth and then start again with your lips closed.  Personally I think this is silly and I don't mind a small amount of water getting on the sink.  Could Waterpik bend the tip in such a way so that no water would run down on your hand?  Maybe but I think that would also make the unit really awkward to use.

Another complaint is that the Waterpik is not powerful enough.  I'm up to level 6 out of 10 and it has taken me about 3 months to get there.  Even though I now have a lot of experience using the Waterpik there are still times I ""miss"" and hit a soft spot in my mouth and it hurts--even at level 6.  In short, the Waterpik is extremely powerful, IMO, and I've been stuck on level 6 for over 2 weeks (I may not go any higher).  When I turn it up to level 10 and point the stream at the bathtub it is scary strong.  My advice is to start at level 1 and work up very slowly.

I had seen it mentioned that it is too easy to pop off the tip while in use.  This has not happened to me in 3 months of use.  I DO think that the placement of the button for the tip release is unfortunate because you have to be careful not to press it while you're using the Waterpik.

Some have suggested that the reservoir is too small.  In my experience the reservoir is the perfect size for a single use.  I always find that by the time I've done my whole mouth the unit runs out of water.

I have seen suggestions that there are leaks.  I want to make a very careful note here that the way the unit is designed you have to push down firmly on the reservoir once you drop it into the unit.  There is a rubber valve that has to make good contact in order to form a seal.  It isn't necessarily obvious that you need to do this just by looking at the unit (but it is in the directions).

Finally I'd just like to add a couple of my own observations.

The ""footprint"" of this unit is very small.  I really was happy about that because I have a tiny bathroom sink and i was wondering where I would put it.

Also, a waterpick is a really important part of dental hygiene and I think everyone should consider using it.  I don't personally think it replaces flossing but it makes your flossing much more effective (I generally use the Waterpik after flossing and before brushing).

If there are any questions just leave me a comment!

Edit: Long term follow-up.  The unit still works but the temporary stop button sticks now every time I use it.  To unstick it I have to turn off the unit and then tap the handle until it unsticks.

Final follow-up 9/15/11:  The unit finally stopped working altogether.  I'm not upset about it.  I can see by my order date that this pik lasted about 2 years.  Also, I think it says something that just today I ordered the exact same model.",1244246400,0,0,0,0,1

This man-specific shaving serum is very different from the more familiar shaving foams and gels that my husband normally buys.  For a start, the airless pump container requires priming the pump, meaning you have to expel all the air out of the bottle before the contents start to come out in any quantity.  Once done, the fairly viscous clear gel is delivered in short burst.  Although tempted to pile it on thickly, my husband started with an amount similar to an almond and found it to be quite sufficient to address a week-old growth.

I felt the consistency of the serum applied to damp skin, and it reminded me more of a face cream than a shaving product, but I have to say, the razor was gliding very easily, leaving behind soft, smooth, bare skin.  Once the shaving was done, a little rinsing with clear water produced a milky white residue which was quickly absorbed.  The scent is delicious, a little sweet until body chemistry adapts it, but I detected vanilla and some of the lighter herbal elements.

The ingredients include some lovely botanical compounds like rice bran oil, sunflower oil, extracts of yarrow, peppermint, melissa and mallow, vitamin E and coumarin, a phytochemical responsible for the vanilla-like scent.  The blurb says it's a multi-purpose product that can also be used as a face wash and moisturizer, so it would be useful on a trip when luggage space is at a premium, but my husband is going to use it strictly for shaving, since there is also a very creamy moisturizer in the range.

The scent is very strong from the bar and I smell it in the bathroom, but it doesn't linger on the skin so it won't clash with your perfume. The soap leaves my skin feeling very clean and it doesn't dry it out.

I've used Pre de Provence soaps in the past and have always had good luck with them. The soap is hard milled and doesn't melt away too quickly. I have a wooden Pre de Provence retail display box that is about 10 years old and it still smells like their soap.

ORGASM may be the holy grail of blusher for many fairer women, but I'm an NC44 Latina (med-dark olive tone) and that color would not make a showing on me. I did find that two colors have become my staple blushes.

For warm-tone days, I use EXHIBIT A, a matte blush that is scary in the pan (so brightly orange-red) that most women would think ""Bozo the Clown"". No, it works beautifully on my tone, brightening me (we olive toned women can look sallow and blah without a color pop). Fabulous.

For cool days (and by cool I'm talking my color choices for clothes and lipstick, not weather), I like  MATA HARI. It's a matte cool pink tone that is deep enough to show on my cheeks and give me a look that says ""Healthful"" or ""just went for a quick jog and has blood circulating well"". Nice.

I plan to try CRAZED and TAOS, which seem to be shimmery cousins to my two faves (ie, one is warmer, one is cooler).

I think the thing is to head to a store like Sephora and just try the shades. With the array of beautiful colors, you will find a couple or more colors that make you feel and look great.

NOTE: You really need a quality brush to get just enough pigment and deposit not too much pigment. That's my recommendation. These blushes do not come with little cheapo rough brushes like so many do. No, get a good blush brush--a MAC one, or a Sephora, etc. I use the MAC duo-fiber brush, smaller one, and it works very well with these strong shades.

Yes, pricey. But I've gone through so many disappointing blushes in drugstore brands and even from some name brands, that it's a relief to find blushers that WORK for me and make me happy and don't make me itch!

Hurrah for NARS.

The recharging stand has worked well enough for me in the past, and I've never had any issue with bacteria on my brush heads.  Rinse thoroughly after use and tap to get the water out, that should be enough in my opinion.  As the ""biologist"" stated in his review, this seems a bit like overkill.

I do not like other items in the kit.  Both the toothpaste and the rinse have a warning saying that they may cause teeth staining.  What is up with that?!  I have been using them for two weeks and I am constantly worried about staining.  After brushing, I now spend time to examine my teeth to see if they became stained.  So far, I don't think they did, but if I see a stain I will blame these products simply because of the warning.  Staining of teeth is not something people should worry about when brushing their teeth.  Incidentally, SmartMouth rinse states that it will not stain teeth or dentures.  I do not want to be concerned with teeth staining when using tooth care products, so I will look for products that do not contain a possibility to cause staining.

I have sensitive teeth, so I normally use Sensodine toothpaste which was recommended by every dentist I have seen.  Crest Pro-Care toothpaste has never been recommended to me by a dentist, although it claims to help with hyper-sensitivity.  I did not notice Crest helping with sensitivity better than Sensodine.  According to dentists I visited, teeth sensitivity is a result of tooth enamel erosion.  My dentists always recommended SOFT bristled brushes to reduce erosion.  The toothbrush included in this kit has MEDIUM bristles, which may promote erosion of the enamel.  Crest might have included medium toothbrush to combat the potential staining, but this is just my guess.

I do not think that this is a good collection of products because of the potential teeth staining by the toothpaste and the rinse, and because the toothbrush has medium bristles which may promote enamel erosion and increase sensitivity.  Additionally, items in this kit will likely run out at different times, so consumers are unlikely to purchase this as a kit more than once.  At the time of this review the price is not available, so I cannot comment on value, but I do not see why one would be more interested in buying these products as a kit than individually.",1374192000,0,1,0,0,0

One thing that was odd about this is the lid was on rather loosely with no safety seal.  Some of the product had leaked into its inner shipping poly bag.  Perhaps a safety seal would eliminate this from happening as well as add a modicum of safety.

It does a good job, but some pieces of hair are just too short for its barrel. Any type hot brush is hard to find in a real store, so I started my initial search at Amazon instead.  1/2"" is the perfect size for short haircuts.  I prefer added body rather than outright curls, and this does that if the barrel is kept on my hair for about 6-8 seconds.

It only has two settings (low/high) compared to Conair's many.  That's okay--once I found the perfect Conair setting, I never moved it elsewhere anyway.  The high setting on Helen of Troy seems to deliver the same amount of heat as Conair's highest setting, so I'm happy.

Thank you, Amazon, for stocking a hard to find product and thank you, Helen of Troy, for making it.

Suffice it to say that this is a very well priced shaver/trimmer that has all the attachments one could want for everything from trimming hair, to that of your nose and ears as well.  It's small, easy to hold and handle, and shaped in such a way that makes even doing ones back of the neck easy.  It charges up quickly and lasts long enough to do several trimming jobs before you need to plug it in again.  About the only couple of things I can say I don't like about this trimmer is there is no stand that comes with it for storing it upright in between charges. (but they do give you a little nylon bag to store all the attachments in). That wouldn't be so bad, save for the fact that the trimmers bottom is very small and it tips over easily when you just set it down upright.  It would have been nice if they either offered a little stand to store it in, or made the base of the unit a little bigger for stability.  The other is a minor irritant, but one that I am sure many will well identify with.  The instruction booklet is not a booklet at all but one of those big thin fold out papers like the the old road maps.  Its in 40 languages like everything is these days and its very difficult to read it when all spread out and follow it in English or any other language.  And trust me, you should read the instructions on this before just trying it out.  It helps with getting used to how the different heads attach and are most efficient.

+ The Brush Part - The center with the freshener is also like a tiny bit of toothpaste/mouthwash as my teeth,gums and overall mouth feel very clean after I use this. Still I REGULAR BRUSH and floss at least 2 - 3 times per day.

+ The Pick Part - Yes, the pick is a hard plastic, yet it is very thin and works just like a toothpick, yet better than a toothpick because there is no wood to break (I have broken so many toothpicks, so this is so so much better).

+ Other Uses I Have Found - Twice a day, I use PLAX Rinse before brushing and then begin my regular brushing with this tiny brush as it has firm enough bristles to flake off the Plaque and even some tartar. (The PLAX Rinse takes at least 2 weeks to really see hard tartar coming off by the way - yet this firm brush seems to help the process for me).

Highly recommend this to all!",1387756800,0,0,0,0,1

One of my favorite products to test out (besides masks of course) is hand cream!  I cannot even tell you how many hand creams I have tested over the years.  I'm fairly picky about my hand creams, however, I also like a variety of hand creams to choose from.  Sometimes I want a light hand cream that absorbs quickly and other times I want a nice and thick hand cream that will just sit and kind of marinate on my hands and then eventually soak in.  I also like a hand cream that falls somewhere in between.  Where I am and what I am doing always influences what kind of hand cream I use.
This Hand Cream by LeiaSea has been my one and only ""go-to"" Hand Cream for several weeks now!  Which is kind of amazing since I have about 5 different ones that I use on an everyday basis.  It just provides the perfect amount moisture to my overly dry hands without feeling greasy and also leaves them feeling incredibly soft and silky.  I also really like the light, fresh scent and a little goes a long way so that is a bonus too!  I've also been using it on my feet and it has really helped soothe and heal my dry, cracked heels.  The Leliasea Hand Cream definitely gets a 5-Star rating from me!

No more trying to stretch to reach washing the middle of my back. I use this for washing everywhere and am loving it. These are not real rough on your body but real soft either since they are used for exfoliating too. They have not hurt me or anyone in my family and none of us have gotten irritated by them. They actually feel good on your body in my opinion.

The braiding is tighter but they stretch well and spring back afterwards. They haven't loosened up a whole lot which is nice. They do stretch a lot and can end up stretching to 35"" in length! They have a rope card on both ends which make them easier to hold and control while using. The colors are nice and bright and you get 5 different so everyone in the family can have a different color and they won't get mixed up. Overall, I am very happy with these.

Just a few passes through my hair and it is straight. It straightens my hair in degrees - so if I still want a little wave pattern I only pass it through my hair once. If I want it straighter then I pass it through about 6 times.

I found the best way to use this is to pull my hair taunt and then pass the brush through. Not one has it scorched my hair, but I will say the unit does get hot on the round part - not the handle.

You can change the temperature reading from Celsius to Fahrenheit with the digital display on the handle. There is also a way to lock the temperature on the handle too. This is good since it is easy to accidently turn the brush off while using it since the off/on button is on the handle too.

The only thing I do not like about this brush is that it is a Chinese product, so the writing on the brush is Chinese. I hope they market a version to those that read English. This in no way takes away from how well the product works,

5051,5,"11 3, 2013",A25C2M3QF9G7OQ,B00CZH3LQG,"This is a great way to package everything (well, almost everything) needed for dental care in a single package. It includes an Oral-B powered toothbrush, toothpaste, mouthwash, and floss. I'll cover each separately.

Oral-B 1000 - I have owned several Oral-B toothbrushes over the years, both basic models as well as their more advanced models. I find the 1000 series offers the best value by far. It doesn't have any of the bells and whistles as the more advanced (and much more expensive) models such as a separate display unit and multiple brushing modes, but it gets the job done and does it well. It's compact, easy to take along for travel, and simple to use.

While I've also used the Sonicare line of powered brushes, Oral-B is my favorite brand by far. I find it cleans my teeth better and the replacement heads (of which there are a variety to select from) are less expensive. My favorite heads are the Floss Action and the Extra Soft (not included in this kit - must be purchased separately). The heads in this kit (two are included - the Precision Clean and the Deep Sweep) are also good, but for my needs, not as effective as other head styles.

Toothpaste - I didn't care for the Crest toothpaste but that's due to the fact that I need to use a sensitive formulation. Other types, such as this, contribute to tooth pain for me. I didn't detract from the rating due to this since that's not a fault of the toothpaste.

Mouthwash - classic Scope. About as classic as you can get. Simple, tastes good, works well.

Floss - my usual brand is the Oral-B regular Glide so it was interesting to compare it with this version (the ""Pro-Health""). The Pro-Health seems to be thicker and more durable than the regular, but I can't say that it cleaned any better. Any version of Glide is, in my opinion, far better than any other floss if you have tightly spaced teeth. It gets between my teeth far more easily and comfortably than any other brand.

Overall, a great dental health kit that comes packed in a nice (but somewhat smallish) tote bag. Highly recommend!",1383436800,0,0,0,0,1

The good points:
1. Unlike our older Norelco circa 2003, everything is ONE uniform piece.  The other shaver had soooo many pieces to keep track of that it became cumbersome.

2. The shaver head contours and flexes to the shape of your face and neck.  Anyone who shaves regularly knows how difficult it can be to get every little hair.  This system provides a clean, smooth shave.

3. On the back of the shaver there is a button that when pressed a small tripper conveniently pops up.  We used the trimmer to trim his sideburns and mustache.  VERY USEFUL... opposed to looking for that little scissor.

4. Quick charge; right out of the box only charged for one hour and we were able to shave his face.  About 15-20 minutes of use.

5. EXTREMELY EASY clean up of the head.  Just push a button, the head opens and you run under the water.

6. Also comes with a nice little brush to use pre-wash for clean-up of the excess hair.  Not for your face, but for the trimmer and shaver head.

The not so bad...
1.  The reason it is missing a star is because I miss how my old Norelco had a little compartment for the Nivea shaving gel/lotion.  The trimmer takes the place of that slot.. so it is worth it even though I miss that cream.

Would highly recommend at a great price!!  We are loving this Norelco.

However, everything in here was nice. I've never used a heated eyelash curler but I was happy with the results. I wish there had been instructions on how to use it, but I just turn it on when I start my makeup and I do my mascara at the end to give it time to warm up. It takes two AAA batteries. I use the eyeliner brush with the spooly brush at the end as a clean up brush for nail polish, and it works great for that. I also use the pointed tweezers to pick up nail vinyls which works SO MUCH better than using my hands. The slanted ones, I actually use for my eyebrows and they are good. They grab my fine hairs as well as the deeply rooted thick ones. The mirror compact is in my purse. No complaints there. The scissors cut and I like the slant.

This is a powerful moisturizer and feels so luxurious when you apply it. I was so surprised. I have dry skin so my skin just soaked it right up and loved it but for some other people it could be too moisturizing, so that is why you should only use it at night before you go to bed. You will wake up with really moisturized and fresh skin. That is how my skin felt. You do not need to use much at all. Just a little bit because it really is a powerful moisturizer. Any excess I had, I would just apply it to my hands and my hands felt great afterwards.

 I love that this is packed with antioxidants that my skin needs. My skin loved this. My face felt soft and moisturized. There is no fragrance, which is great! Fragrance is actually bad for your face because of the chemicals they use and no one needs fragrance in a face moisturizer anyways. It smells natural, the way the scent should be. I had no reactions or irritations at all. I honestly love this moisturizer. It feels so luxurious just like a high-end brand or what a spa would give you. This is a high quality and wonderful retinol moisturizing cream that does what it is supposed to do. I am so happy to have found this cream. I highly recommend it for anyone wanting a retinal cream or have dry skin. It does come with a pink plastic bag for traveling too. I was not too impressed with it, though.

The sprayer is adjustable, and I prefer to use it as a fine mist. Instead of misting my sheets before getting into bed, I mist them when I am making my bed.

As soon as I got this product at home, I wanted to see what this mysterious Sweet Oil was. It is Pure Olive Oil. Now I know Olive Oil is expensive, especially the really cool kind, but this is crazy. Almost two dollars for one ounce of this!!! Had I known, I would have simply walked into my kitchen and helped myself to some Extra Virgin Olive Oil. Course, for this rarified price, we got a dropper, but dearie, you can help yourself to a dropper at Walgreens for 69 cents!!!!!  We should all save ourselves the cost of shipping, packaging, and receiving. Go to the local pharmacy and buy a dropper. Get some olive oil from the kitchen. To make it more effective, heat your olive oil just the tinniest bit. There. Now you have ""Sweet Oil"" and a dropper and it is warmed and you did not have to order a blinking thing.
Using this product made my ear feel good, but I cannot report truthfully and say that it softened any wax or helped remove it. My ears are not in bad shape as I actually use Hydrogen Peroxide on them and that cleans them quite effectively. I was lured with this Sweet Oil thing thinking it was some wonderful concoction.

My first Norelco did not have the newer heads that conform to your face, and while I got a good shave, it wasn't great.  My next Norelco had floating heads that did a much better job.  I also decided to shave my head, and the Norelco did a good job of conforming to my head. When that razor needed new blades I decided to splurge and get this one, since a set of heads would cost as much as a new razor.

This model looks like something from outer space and conforms well to my neck and any indented spaces.  It does not conform that well to my head, but the first time I used it I could feel and hear it cutting better than any of the other Norelco's I've used.  It also gives a closer shave than the others, but not as good as a foil shaver or a blade.

It is much easier to clean than the others, as each blade opens individually and you can really get in there with the faucet. They also recommend running the razor in a sink filled with soapy water.  Since one of the hardest things to do with a Norelco is clean it, this is a huge improvement over earlier models.

If it just shaved a little closer, and conformed a bit better to my head, it would have earned an easy 5 stars.

BTW, if you've never used an electric or a rotary razor before, you have to give it a chance. It comes with a satisfaction warranty, but give it the full test before you write it off.

It also comes with a great travel/charge ""pod"" that should protect the razor from everything short of a nuclear blast.",1196208000,0,0,0,1,0

Yes, it really has all of these qualities (amazed me when first tried it). This product makes even me feel sexy. After applying it your skin feels satiny soft without the wetness and greasy feeling you get from products like Olay or Nivea. To be honest, I almost feel lucky using this cream,like it is a hidden secret or something. I don't think it would be possible for anyone to regret purchasing a jar as it is well worth the money. A little bit really goes such a long way and the fact that it lasts all day makes it by far a superior product. I really can't think of anything negative to say, and I would share of there were something.

This body cream, as another review said, is extremely sexy. I can't say enough good things about it. Its not greasy like many commercial products, doesn't feel wet after you apply, and doesn't linger a strong fragrance that overpowers or causes irritation in anyway. In addition, a small amount of cream really goes a long way and lasts all day. You don't have to apply and reapply like many other lotions. I often see people reaching for their lotion what seems like hourly because their hands are constantly dry. I can't imagine it being all that healthy applying lotion with chemicals in it several times a day.

It is completely different and better than any product as it really is natural and doesn't contain any chemicals whats so ever. I would recommend this to anyone who uses lotion. Don't waste your money on products that say, ""All natural"" when they really are not. So many people buy new brands of lotion regularly always looking for a better product. Buy this lotion, I promise you will not need nor want to look further. The ingredients are healthy, safe, completely natural, have great benefits, and just all around feels great. Lastly, and just as important, the customer service is wonderful. The company really cares about your hard earned money. If you do the math, this product is actually cheaper in the long run compared to products like olay, nivea, and the like. I wish I had come across this cream years ago.",1290988800,0,0,0,0,1

5402,5,"12 15, 2014",A2LAS014NSRW72,B00MH07GZ8,"I am astonished.  Really.  Truly.  I have somewhat dry skin with alot of sensitivity: it often feels as if it's sunburned.  When it's not. So I was hesitant to try a chemical peel, but wanted to because I have some major discoloration.  Mostly from sun damage, mostly on my cheekbones and cheeks.  Just little tan spots here and there. I also have a bit of small scars from old acne, almost as if they healed with a change in pigmentation.

SO, I tried this out, using the Ebook from the Carbon company for advice on how to do it.  I was sort of chicken so started with two minutes only, and I exfoliated with ExfoliKate by Kate Sommerville first.  Put it on, no sting, rinsed it off after two minutes.  Used a baking soda solution to neutralize the acid (will try and find the ebook link so you can see their recipe).  Rinsed more and more and then used the Serum designed to work with it (I will review it separately, it's called Hyaluronic Acid, also by Carbon).  I was expecting to feel sunburned the next day but didn't.

Here's the thing, it worked amazing the first time.  I noticed one side of my space especially looked clearer and more even (maybe I sat in the sun and one side is worse??).  I couldn't believe it.  I waited one week and did it again.  Still, an improvement. I really can't even explain.  It's just evener and the brown spots are almost gone.  I'm sticking to the two minute regimen for now, I'm still too chicken to go for longer.  I'm going to keep doing it weekly for now.

I did get a bit crazy and used it on my cleavage (decollete?) because I have many many discoloring sun spots.  Didn't notice as much improvement there, possibly because the discoloration is pretty bad.  Will keep trying.

The wildest thing was this, however: I did the back of my hands and the top of my feet as well.  (You only need a tiny bit).  My hands are quite beat up and discolored with various scars etc, and the top of my feet looked sort of awful because of a summer of flip-flops and weird tan lines and always dinging my feet on something or other.  There was hugely noticeable improvements in both of these areas.  Each time I followed the same regimen.

On my feet, I also used (the next day) a whitening cream from another manufacturer, and left it on all day. It really made my feet look pretty and softer and between it and the chemical peel, looks great for winter.

Very very pleased.

This is a generous amount of dried (loose) lavender blossoms designed to act in the same fashion as potpourri. The most important aspect to this product is the scent which I found to be delicate and natural. Lavender in general can be fairly overbearing, and you can smell this through the packet as it is relatively potent. However, it is not cloying or suffocating in its potency. I'm guessing this is because it's not as concentrated as a perfume or extract.

When you have the bag open and are exposed to all of it at once, it seems really strong, but as something you place in a location in lesser quantities, it doesn't tend to be so overbearing. I think that it strikes a good balance between being potent enough to have an effect and not being so potent as to make you queasy from a strong scent. I have had a lavender-scented face mask (the sort filled with beans that you heat or cool and apply to your face) for some time and found that putting that mask in a plastic zipper bag with a sachet made from these dried blossoms helped revived the fading scent quite well without have to risk staining the mask or making it smell too strong from using oils or perfume.

If there is any weak point to this, it is the presentation which can be a bit messy. I had to be very careful when opening the package not to spill the small, dried bits. It would have been better if it had come in a resealable package or a jar of some sort given how tiny they are. I decanted mine into a jar both to keep the scent contained in the long run and to more easily manage them. Still, since this point is intrinsic to the type of product this is (tiny dried blossoms), I'm not dinging it for that, but just noting it.",1505520000,0,0,0,0,1

I own the 8260XL and the reason I did not get him that model is because I knew he would not use the Jet Clean System.  This razor is very good for my Dad, but as for me it's a different story!  I collect Norelco Electric Razors.  I have the Spectra James Bond Razor, the Smart Touch XL with the minute display, and the Arcitec 1050cc with the Jet Clean System, and the 8260XL with the Jet Clean System.  Now which one shaves the best?  First, unlike my Dad, I have a heavy dark beard and I have to shave every morning and sometimes in the afternoon to keep from getting a shadow.  For me, all of these razors shave ok, just ok, never as close as a blade!, but the best of these razors are the Spectra James Bond Razor and the Smart Touch XL.  These two razors shave pretty close.  The 8200 series is ok, and I will leave it at that.  The razors in the 8200 series  are all pretty much the same except as you move up the line you get more bells and whistles. All the razors in the 8200 series shave the same.  I shave with the Arcitec 1050cc and the 8260XL and rotate between the two. At present, they are doing a pretty good job, but sometimes I  bring my other razors out of retirement.  I like to use Mennen Afta Pre Electric Loation and a little talc powder which helps me to achieve a close comfortable shave. Williams Lectric Shave is too greasey.  After shaving, I put on a little Mennen Afta After Shave Skin Conditioner or Nivea Post Shave Balm which helps my skin from becoming dry. I do not get razor burn from any of these electric razors. I do like the Jet Clean System that came with my Arcitec 1050cc and 8260XL.  I always wash out my razors before I use them in the cleaning system which helps to save on the cleaning solution.  The cleaning solution last about a month and it can be purchased at Walmart or you can have it delivered right to your door every month by purchasing it from Amazon. Norelco has been a trad in my family for years.  My Dad, Grandfathers and Great Grandfathers all shaved with Norelco Electric Razors.  I'm 47 and I have been shaving with them for the most part since I started shaving.  I have had problems with Norelco though.  There have been times when a relatively new Norelco Razor would just quit on me, but I am happy to say that Philips Norelco ALWAYS replaced the defective razor!  If you want to get a close comfortable shave stick with Norelco.  Shaving with Norelco Electric Razors is better then the mess of soap and water and you don't have to buy blades and shaving cream all the time.-Michael",1249344000,0,0,0,0,1

More like a chemical mixture gone wrong.
There was also way more oil in this scrub than I expected which left me feeling greasy (not hydrated or moisturized), and I'm not really a fan of that. Add to all that the fact that this made a huge mess in my shower and you can see why I only gave this 3 stars.

So basically when using this you need to accept the fact that you *will* be scrubbing your tub/shower afterwards. It leaves a ton of ""grounds"" or whatever all over the tub, as well as a greasy residue. It melts into a brown sludge which stained my grout.

I also have a ped egg, which works,  but you have to sit there filing away and can't get precision as well as this thing allows.  I use this when I'm done with a shower or bath all over the bottom of my foot. It can easily get through a layer of dead skin as well as the extra skin around my toes.  I tried to have a before and after picture so you could see. It took off the layer quite easily.  The directions say to only press on an area for no longer than a couple seconds,  but I passed this over the whole thing several times as well as concentrated on my toed and was fine.  I used it in the callouses on top of my big toe knuckle and it took those off quite easily. My only warning to people is that if this is your first time and you have many callouses, go easy and do less the first couple times.  It will take your feet a bit to adjust to being so fresh to the world.  I went too deep with my shower rock one time and went right through the outer layer of skin- it didn't bleed or anything,  but my skin was very fresh, moist, and felt weak. Another thing to note is that the directions say to charge at least 10 hours but no more than 16 hours. I didn't notice that and accidentally charged for about 22 hours.

The bar itself is large, and it took a little extra grip from the usual bath size bars I use. But, the formula is creamy and smooth, lathers nicely and doesn't leave my skin dry. I can't say it's the most moisturizing of bars, but it feels really nice and rinses completely.

5475,5,"01 23, 2016",AI8DDPX23JCV2,B00NT0AR7E,"I started using retinol products (other than this one) about a year ago after reading so many reports about the benefits of Vitamin A (in the form of retinol) for aging skin (or skin in general).  It certainly made a difference to my face and has kept my skin youthful.

Overall I really like this retinol serum for a few reasons.  I have used retinol creams before and I don't always want a cream.  I like that this is a serum - so I like that can get the benefits of retinol without having to put on a heavy cream.  Also it's lightweight and dries quickly, making it easy to use.

I love that this is in a airless pump bottle (which I will definitely be refilling when it's empty) because it keeps the lotion bacteria free.  I think that small, often overlooked, aspect of this type of packaging truly helps my skin stay clear.  Using face lotions in airless pumps prevents growth of bacteria inside your face products and thus minimizes the amount of bacteria that goes on your skin when you apply them.  This is why I like to transfer my serums into airless pump bottles as well as my liquid foundations etc.

Some words of advice when purchasing retinol creams/serums.  Make sure it actually contains RETINOL.  Some retinol creams/serums that say ""retinol"" on the front of the bottle actually contain a derivative of vitamin A that is less effective (for your skin) and cheaper (for the manufacturer), which is retinyl palmitate.  Make sure if a bottle says it's retinol, that the ingredient list says retinol, like this product.

I use some to store extra pills in, and even in a warm room, the jars stay cool. That is very important, especially with gelatin capsules that can melt if they get too hot. I suspect that these jars stay so cool because of the nice thick glass. I absolutely love the size of these. I can't find a reason that someone would NOT be able to use these. I also like the sort of modern design and shape of these glass jars. Other jars are more square and box-like, but these are more rounded. The black plastic screw tops are nice and sturdy as well. You might notice that the price is at least a few bucks more than other glass jars of the same size. I've looked through dozens and dozens of them on Amazon. I honestly think that if you make DIY goods and want to sell a nice, good-looking product, you may want to consider these jars over cheaper ones. These are beautiful and sturdy jars. They look attractive as well as doing what they're made for. They will not break or shatter easily, they don't smell weird, they're totally airtight, they're really cute in size, and like I said... they're perfect.

2nd Purchase: I purchased another set of these glass jars and this time, they came in bad condition. The first order was 5 stars. But with this one, the lids are all worn and totally scratched up as if they've been used a LOT. Even the original jars I handle often never get that half that bad.

It would be 5 stars, except I hate the fragrance & its the kind that unfortunately sticks around. However, I find ways around that by putting either vicks vapor rub or coconut oil just inside of my nose. Sounds weird but it works! Another thing I'm not a huge fan of is the stickiness that it sets to, but i find applying the slightest bit of translucent powder just in the middle of the lips will set it, or i put a little nude lipstick over the center sticky area that bothers me.

Seems like a lot of complaints, but overall it really is a great product to test out. I tend to rub my lips together before I speak, so that may be why I am bothered by the stickiness. & scent is pretty subjective as well, The price is amazing & I get constant compliments on the lip color.

(Apparently some of my Pre De Provence products are showing up in one review - so while this reveiw is for bath salts, I have the lavender lotion as well, which I do love the scent of it but as with the bath salts, wish the bottle were nicer).

There was no seal on the top of the jar, just the lid. That's fine, but I would wonder how long it would sit on a shelf before purchasing and how ""fresh"" the scent would last. That said, when I opened the lid and took a whiff, it was pretty powerfully scented. I like the lavender aspect but there's another scent there that I don't like and can't figure out what it is. It's off-putting. It doesn't linger in the water, so that's good.

I sprinkled some in my bathroom sink that I'd filled with warm water. The water turned a slight lavender shade as the bath salts turned clear. The salt crystals did melt pretty quickly, though as with any bath salts I've used there are always a few that are stubborn.

The water felt soft enough, I suppose-nothing really special, but that strong scent wasn't as apparent in the diluted water.

I did think it a bit pricey at just under $17 (at time of this review). For that price, I'd like a glass bottle or something prettier in the jar design itself, though the lavender-colored crystals do look pretty. Still, there are plenty of bath salts out there that are half the price and smell about the same, so what would make me want to purchase this one exclusively? Something that made it attractive to me, and that would be a pretty bottle/jar that I could display in my bathroom in my basket of bath goodies. Or, to give someone as a gift.

This plastic jar makes it seem like one of those cheaper jars of bath salts you can buy at Big Lots, which I can do for less than half the price if I want bath salts. Pretty it up some so I feel I'm getting my money's worth. You cold say Pre De Provence has quality ingredients and maybe that's why the price, but I'm not finding it special enough to pay almost $17.",1504137600,0,0,1,0,0

It felt to me like you were putting on a thin lair of gear grease under your arm. I just wasn't into gaging how well it worked for I didn't enjoy the slime that went along with it.  Then the clear gel came along, which is sorta like a thick liquid that goes on kinda wet and cool feeling, but dries very quickly and best of all, isn't slimy like other old spice solids.  As far as the clear gels staying power, it definitely lasts longer than the original formula, and in case I didn't mention it, isn't slimy like their endurance formula.

7397,5,"10 3, 2013",A2JCJJNY43QQIV,B005AQC9U8,"When everyone was wearing clear or neutral glosses, I wasn't phased. I'm a red lipstick addict from way back, and I just toned down the red and added a little gloss to update it.

Thank God, though, it looks like real, pure reds are making a comeback. I read about Besame's vintage cosmetics line, and as my MAC red was about gone, I figured I'd try one of their reds.

My coloring is a brunette with a very fair complexion. Frankly, except for goth dark reds, I can wear pretty much any shade. I picked Besame Red since it seemed middle of the line in terms of color, and I wanted to get an idea how this cosmetics line worked.

The first thing that surprised me is it comes on a card. This lipstick isn't cheap; you'd think the packaging would be a little nicer. (I get they're trying to do vintage cosmetics, but if you're going to make it look like Coty or Max Factor from the 40s, you probably don't want to charge a hefty price for it.)

The other surprise is that the tube isn't heavy. Everyone raves about the metal container, but like so? It's lightweight. I've had some heavy lipstick containers from luxury lines that bragged about the lipstick containers being jewel-like, and they were.

This container isn't.

So now with my quibbles out of the way, let me say the lipstick itself is NICE. Some said the lipstick is small; it isn't. It seems about the size of most lipsticks with a double bevel to make putting it on easy.

I always use a lipbrush (does away with lipliner and makes lipstick in the case last FOREVER. You'll get tired of the lipstick before it runs out.)

The first surprise is the scent. I don't recall any lipstick except some glosses having a discernable scent. This one does, rather vanilla-y. It's pleasant.

The lipstick texture in the tube is, surprisingly, moist. It goes on easily, but it's not so moisturizing that the color doesn't last.

I put it on and did the old fashioned lip blotting with a piece of toilet paper. With a super slushy lipstick, this will almost take the entire thing off. Not so with Besame. The color is very saturated and stayed on my lips nicely.

The lip blotting didn't get rid of the moisture. My lips still feel nice. The color lightened up a bit (which happens with blotting.) You're supposed to add another layer of lipstick after this, but I usually don't. The color was still very saturated, so there was no need for more.

The staying power is excellent! It lasted all day, and my lips never dried out.

If you love the color (and use a lipbrush), you'll get WAY more out of this true red to the point where you'll get tired of it before it runs out.

I'm definitely going to be investigating more of the Besame line.

N.B. One other trick that works if you want your lipstick to last into next week. Blot the first coat and put on a bit of powder with your finger - baby powder or compact powder does nicely. Blot again, and put on another coat of lipstick. It'll last through dinner and into next Christmas. :)",1380758400,0,0,0,0,1

My hair feels full and looks full and lightweight.  It holds that fullness without any heaviness throughout the day.

There are several reasons for this: 1) This comb detangles like NOBODY'S business without snagging on or breaking the hair. I have kinky, natual afro hair and it knots up fairly easily. Well, using the Ace comb allows me to get through it without much heartache. 2) This comb is DURABLE! When I buy a comb, I actually LOSE it before it gets damaged or workn out. Most of the time, I have my combs for a few years before I ""lose"" them. 3) As of right now, I can get them locally and they are very reasonably priced. I LOVE this comb and I hope they NEVER stop making it. If it weren't for this comb, I don't know if it would be as easy for me to go without a leave-in, as most combs snag in the hair and require some kind of lubricating product in order for me to get through my hair. Not so with the Ace comb! I also use it on my daughter's hair. She is a tenderhead like me and the Ace comb makes life easy for us both. I also use this as a lifter when I am doing an afro style. I have tried NUMEROUS combs and picks. I even got the ""seamless"" varieties that are three or four times as much. They DO NOT COMPARE!!

It's important not to go too light because the blush WILL look chalky or there will be no color payoff. So far these colors have been most flattering
1. Mata hari
Matte mauve pink. Gorgeous for everyday adds a natural looking flush to the cheeks. It is lighter than MAC slave to love blush which was one of my old favorites before I tried NARS!
2. Taos
Described as a dusty rose, but has coral tones on my skin tone. Has some shimmer but not very noticeable once applied to the skin. This one is very long lasting. Nice for brightening up your day...and your complexion!
3. Taj mahal
Looks very gold in the pan but adds such a pretty warmth to the cheeks that's a little shimmery and lit from within. There are many ravs about this blush on beauty blogs and YouTube and its true!
4. Desire
A scary bright bright bright pink in the pan but also very good quality giving cheeks the natural flush you crave for everyday. I've also seen this one on deeper skin tones and it still looks natural and flattering
5. Love joy
I was wondering if this would show up or just look like shimmer on my skin. After application it was a brownish berry color with slight shimmer and the blush I choose when I'm doing a strong smoky or colorful eye look. Looks very natural on my skin tone. Can't really be used to contour because it has the berry tone. The nars site describes this of a bronzed rose but on skin tones similar to mine would be berry toned.
6. Exhibit A
I've seen this on light medium and deep skin tones and it is widely flattering! Turns more red than orange on my skin but can look more orange on you depending on your undertones. Every woman should have this one in their arsenal. Some people believe this gives the most natural looking flush of all. It also photographs really well and looks good on video! Lol :)

Start your collection with any one of these if you're skin tone is similar to mine. NARS blush is one of the best blush brands out there I encourage you to try at least one even thought they have a higher price point. They are very pigmented and last a long time too!

Edit
I have grown my collection!
Torrid : a peachy shimmer....you would not believe how beautiful this is on my cheek...that lit from within look!

Sin: glowy mauvy cheeks very beautiful. Also gorgeous on lighter skin tones to my own

Dolce vita: with a very light hand i can pull this one off. A little harder to blend than the others

Amour: my new go to everyday color. Very beautiful and natural on my complexion. Probably the orgasm or deep throat for deeper complexions. I'm a mac nc43 btw. My love affair with nars continues.....",1343952000,0,0,0,0,1

They want to improve profit margin.  The plastic is ok, but if there was a choice . . . I'd take glass.  #2  Whoever designed and then signed off on this horrid bottle should be fired. I suspect in the interest of getting the consumer to use more, the hole in the top of the bottle is too big.  It seems impossible to dispense this into your hand without some of the product running down the side of the bottle and leaving a blue stain on your sink (or tabletop) when you set it down.",1296864000,0,0,0,0,1

The scent is quite strong and lasting and it is relatively affordable. The company behind it is based in France, where a large part of the worlds lavender is grown.

Lavender itself has a fascinating history. While we think of it as a dried flower to be used for potpourri and sachets, historically it has been used more as food item, being used in baked goods and desserts, pairing especially well with chocolate. Lavender is said to have a flavor resembling rosemary and is often used as a substitute.  It is generally considered safe although the U.S. health department has issued precautions for young boys concerning possible hormonal changes. On the other hand, according to the ASPCA lavender has been shown to be toxic to dogs, toxic to cats and toxic to horses.

A suggestion to the company would be to switch to a different bag other than cellophane, which tears easily. I had more dried leaves in the box than I did in what was left of the cellophane bag.  Im sure using more of an air-tight sealed bag would also ensure less loss of potency than cellophane.

The first go round it was hard to snap the little disc, but the second go around I barely had to touch it. Once you activate the disc the heat packs gets firmer, the longer it heats, the firmer it gets, until it is a hard pouch. To reactive it again, you boil it for 15 minutes and let it cool down. Then it's as good, and as floppy, as new.

The packs get pretty hot. I tested it with my object thermometer and the hottest it tested at was 120 degrees Fahrenheit. That was right after snapping the disc. The heat (hot to warm) lasted about one hour. These little pouches are pretty cool. I like them. It was the perfect size to hold on my ear, and it sure helped my earache.

6243,4,"03 3, 2016",AJ9ZYMEUY14AX,B013TXDDJY,"Overview: I had a baby a year and a half ago, and gained forty pounds that wouldn't budge. I lost 20 lbs on my own, but the last 25 have been stubborn. After losing 4 more pounds, I still haven't seen the shrinkage in my waistline. Yes, my arms, face, thighs shrink, but the c-section pooch is still there. I got these wraps hoping that I will be able to see some of my loose skin firms up to get rid of the pooch I have. I wear a size large in shirts and size 10 in pants. Before the wrap, my waist measured 36 inches, and after 4 hours using the wrap drinking TONS of water, my waist measured 34.5. 1.5 inches down!

The wraps are not a cream color as shown in the image. They are clear with gel on the inside.

Pros:
-Inches shrunk. My waistline didn't visibly shrink, but it did physically shrink as I lost 1.5 inches. I would have loved to have lost more from the wraps like other ladies.
-Skin felt taut. The skin felt firm upon removal of the wrap. It says to rub the rest of the gel in, but I just wanted to shower the gel off :/
-LARGE. These wraps covered down my pooch under my hip bones, across and around to my back(hips) and even up to my ribcage. I could totally see cutting one in many parts to use it in different areas of the body. You would need some shaaaaarp scissors.
-Easy application. Once you unfold the wrap, it is easy to slap it on and wrap in some plastic wrap. It stays in place.

Cons:
-Plastic wrap. The plastic wrap squinches as you move. It says overnight, but I want to drink water while wearing it! I'd leave it for an at-home spa day.
-Smell. The gel smells like the numbing agent they use at the dentist's office. It made me gag a bit. As soon as the plastic wrap is applied, the smell is no longer apparent.

Grade: This product receives 4 stars because it made me lose inches, but it stinkies!

It contains 3.5 ML of serum which is more than other serums I have tried in the past which contained 2.5 ML for a similar price.

Its easy to apply this very close to the upper lash line (and you can apply to your brows as well, if you wish.

I try to apply this every night before bed and also when I get out of the shower in the morning. I notice more of a difference when I use these products twice per day, although sometimes they say to use it just once per day. So follow the instructions on your package, I'm just saying what I do.

Now don't get me wrong, I don't have falsie-length lashes now. But I do notice that my mascara goes on better now - my lashes are fuller and longer which helps the mascara to do it's job better. I can also tell the difference because before starting, when I curled lashes, I could barely see them when in the curler. But now, I can see that they are almost to the top of the curler when I am curling them. I know that sounds confusing, but it's hard to explain. If you curl your lashes, you will understand hopefully. Just look in the mirror while you curl and notice the length of your lashes compared to the length of your curler?

So with consistent use, I do feel this product makes a difference. It's not a miracle product, and for the most part, no product is. But giving your lashes extra nourishment is a good thing and it's a nice way to pamper yourself and add it to your relaxation and skin care routine! :o)

7827,5,"08 16, 2015",A234YLAS2MYYWA,B00IW58LHE,"Similar in texture and in effectiveness to the Cellulite Reducing Solution by the same brand, this cream is designed to target any body area that could be firmer, smoother, less wrinkly (if your problem area is the chest, there is a more specific product called Breast Firming Solution).  I accepted to test this cream for review purposes with more curiosity than high expectations because my target area is notoriously tough to improve.  I had gained weight and then finally lost some, and was doing my best with exercise and my Slendertone belt, but as long as that little cushion of fat remained over my stomach, I could never see the full impact of my efforts.

That's where this cream comes in.  My stomach problem was not really cellulite but a different type of subcutaneous fat and very difficult to shift.  I must stress that, good as the cream is, it takes time to see results.  It will not magically melt away fatty bulges, it will not reduce your waistline measurement all by itself, and it does not claim to remove stretch marks, but it will improve the elasticity and tone of your skin.  It can make all the difference when your shape is improving, but the skin texture lets you down.  Loose, wrinkly skin is so ageing, as much on the body as it is on the face, but specialist creams like this one are difficult to find.  I'm very glad I gave this a try because the improvement, once it starts to show, is very pleasing.

The cream comes in a medium-sized soft tube (150 ml) and has a fairly thick consistency.  It becomes very white as you spread it, and stays creamy for a while, allowing a good, long massage, which also helps.  Once absorbed, there is no residue.  Among the main active ingredients are caffeine, Vitamin C, carnitine, and algae extracts. It smells deliciously of essential oils and, like the rest of the 180 Cosmetics range, it is a natural product without any toxic chemical additives.  All their products are also cruelty-free, and not tested on animals.

So, if you have the patience and determination to address your imperfect skin, this product will be a great help, but it will be a very gradual process.  Some improvement, however, is easy to see quite quickly.  If your skin is at all lined, with surface creases and a general dry look, this cream will make an immediate impact that goes beyond just moisturizing.  You will also get the uplifting, mood-improving benefits of massage, even though you are doing it yourself.  The only negative I found is that the cap stopped closing after a couple of uses, so I decanted the tube contents into a jar.  It seems to me that this cream would be very helpful during weight loss, even more than afterwards, as the skin would not a have a chance to become loose in the first place.",1439683200,0,0,0,0,1

He still insists that razor a blade gives a closer shave and I agree, the skin is a lot smoother and clearer but this is great for the weekends when he wants to get rid of the stubble and not scratch my face off. This enables him to get a smooth feeling on the skin without stripping and irritating it, and no creams and products are needed. The 3 rotating heads really adjust to the contour of the face and they snap open for easy clean up with water. I've seen him use it and it's a cinch, fast, easy and no mess!

Overall this is a great product, it works well and the face feels and looks good afterwards and it takes very little time to use. Better than shaving when it comes to comfort but my man still prefers the razor when he has to shave for work. This makes a great holiday gift, a gadget that people wouldn't run out and buy for themselves necessarily and fun to have as an option in the morning.

To get the most out of the unit you have to read the manual. It clearly states that you should not leave water in the reservoir (why you would want to anyway is beyond me - why would anyone want to use stale water?). If you don't leave water in it, it won't leak out on your counter. Pretty simple equation there.

I agree with several others that the tongue cleaning attachments are basically useless. They don't fit into the holder anyway, so just toss them out. Sure, try it, but I'll bet you'll find it to be basically useless compared with a true tongue cleaner (i.e., a scraper type device).

The water reservoir could be a bit bigger - an additional 20% bigger would be nice. But, it's very easy to fill even when the unit is running (keep a glass of water handy and just pour it in when the water level is at the half-way point). Simple and easy, and the smaller reservoir does have the benefit of keeping the unit size nice and compact.

Sound level is very low compared with past WaterPik units. No, it's not silent, but it is no more noise than you would get with any other electric appliance in the bathroom such as an electric toothbrush or a shaver.  In fact, it is less noise than my shaver.

The auto-retractable hose is a very nice touch and keeps everything neat. Again, a couple inches longer would be nice, but there's the compact size trade-off again.

In actual performance - wow!  You will never believe that your teeth could get this clean! Wonderful feeling. There is a wide range of power adjustments ranging from very gentle to ouch! I've found setting the dial to the 5/6 range gives a good cleaning without any discomfort.

Good performance at a good price -- can't ask for more than that.",1176595200,0,0,0,0,1

The only two that were truly a luscious cool-red based color were the Avon brand - the Berry Cute (a very nice pure bright cranberry leaning a little towards fuscia-purple but not too much) and Avon Revenge -- a darker cabernet-raspberry - dark but still ""clear"" and bright, as opposed to having muddy brown aspects.

Every other brand and color were in the red-orange-gold-brown spectrum, regardless of the color names or photos that appeared cool or blue-red.

So after all these years - of trying just about every lip balm and lip stick with spf in the drug stores (and now on Amazon) and finding none that weren't a muddy or orange-y or cantaloupe/salmon hue - I am thrilled to have two lipsticks by the same company no less, that I totally love.  Plus, they go on luscious and smooth and shiny, and feel good and have no taste.  I also tried mixing them on my lips at the same time and got a nice retro-clear-red like the 40's movie stars would wear.  These colors are hard to find in any lipstick, much less one with SPF.

I'm thrilled.",1466985600,0,0,0,0,1

PACKAGING: '''''

The oil blend comes in a well-made and good quality glass bottle with a dropper. The bottle is feels sturdy and the dropper works great.

FIRST IMPRESSION: '''''

The blend is clear and it has a light consistency. A little bit goes a long way. I use them on my face, hands, cuticles, and hair. The oil is easy to apply and it does not leave a sticky residue. It does have a glossy finish as soon as you apply it on the skin. I was disappointed because from the description, I was at the impression that it did not leave a oily residue. But I let it absorbed into the skin for a couple of minutes and the skin did not look as shiny. I have oily skin so I do not need extra shine. I do use oils on my skin because they help the skin so much especially oily skin.

PERFORMANCE: '''''

After I used it on my skin one night, I was amazed the next morning. My skin felt nourish and bright. I continue to apply it every night after my toner and serum and it is a nice addition to my skin care routine.

I have also use it on my hair and it has been loving it. I has a light and not greasy texture and it does a nice job at hydrating my hair.

I also apply one or two drop on my hands before going to bed. I also massage the oil on my cuticles and it is great for it.

So far I have been enjoying the texture and the quality of this blend. It is very easy to use and very versatile.

In terms of its oily finish, if you use more than three drops, it will make you skin have a glossy finish. I would advice you to use less than three drops on the face if you want to avoid an oily look. I use it mainly at night so I add three drops and it makes my skin glow and look healthy. Also, if you have dry skin or prefer a glowing make up look, I would recommend that you add one or two drops of the oil to you foundation. It makes your skin look amazing and healthy.

LIKES:

DISLIKES:

  The list of ingredients include Parfum as one of its ingredients. My skin tends to get irritated to add fragrances so I would like to know the origin of the Parfum. Sometimes it comes from natural oils but I could not find information about it.

It has a thin texture and absorbs quickly without any sticky residue.  But it's not primarily water.  Nothing against water, but I prefer my serums to have some thickness to them to allow the ingredients time to penetrate my skin.  This one has the feel of a light cream and a soft citrus scent.  Also the ingredients are superior.  It has the sodium hyaluronate version of HA, biotin, squalane and most importantly 3-O Ethyl Abscorbic acid.  Also the unique pump top bottle gives me full control and delays oxidation.  Highly recommended

The only slight negative is that it's not totally ""invisible""; if you're not careful when putting on a tight top, it will leave some white residue.

Another problem is that Oral B put the grips along the sides of the handle instead of where your fingers and thumb contact it.

I've been trying to make healthy choices such as drinking lots of water, exercising frequently and eating nutritiously. I easily lost 20 pounds, struggled during the last 5 pounds. I have some loose skin that occasionaly needs to be tightened with wraps. These wraps do a great job of making my skin feel more firm. Although I don't get much shrinkage (about an inch and a half each use), these wraps are great for short term results when I need to show my stomach in public like at a pool. The results from the wrap lasts for about 24-48 hours for me before I go back to my normal inches. These wraps are large and can be cut up to use other areas other than the stomach. I don't like to wear these wraps overnight although many people do , because I like to drink tons of water to flush the toxins. I'm talking about drinking 120 ounces at least!!! The wraps stick on and don't leave any residue upon removal. Recommended product! I do wish that I lost more inches from it, though.

Yes, the sandalwood fragrance is there, but there are other scents as well, and together, it all gentles down the sandalwood.  It is a lovely soap, but not the sandalwood fragrance I was hoping for.

I have a bar of Plantlife Sandalwood soap that I bought about six weeks ago,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sandalwood-100-Pure-Natural-Aromatherapy-Herbal-Soap-4-oz-113g/dp/B00112DRHY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sandalwood 100% Pure & Natural Aromatherapy Herbal Soap- 4 oz (113g)</a>.  It has way more sandalwood fragrance than this Pre de Provence.  But, interestingly, I noticed something when I traded that bar for the Pre de Provence:  While the Plantlife has the fragrance, Pre de Provence has the moisturizers.  When using the Pre de Provence, I definitely noticed that my legs, feet, arms, hands were not dry.  As soon as I went back to the Plantlife--just one day--that soap dried out my skin.

So, depends on what you are looking for in your soap.  If you want the intense fragrance, choose Plantlife, and give up soft and smooth skin.  I found both to give great lather, but only the Pre de Provence gave moisture.

A word about the size of this 250g bar:  If you have long fingers or large hands, you will be able to grasp this bar easily.  If you have small hands, you might be better off with the 200g bar,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pre-de-Provence-Shea-Butter-Enriched-Artisanal-French-Soap-Bar-200-g-Traditional-Fragrance-Sandalwood/dp/B001UFZOMS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pre de Provence Shea Butter Enriched Artisanal French Soap Bar (200 g), Traditional Fragrance - Sandalwood</a>, or the soap on a rope,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pre-de-Provence-Soap-On-a-Rope-Sandalwood-200-Gram/dp/B074QWY7CG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pre de Provence Soap On a Rope, Sandalwood, 200 Gram</a>.

This nail stamper kit is similar to ones I have purchased from KONAD designs before. What I love about this kit is the various types of stampers included. I wanted to see if one was easier to use then my Konad with my nail plates.

These stampers are made from plastic and rubber. What you do is fill the nail plate designs (one of your choice) with nail polish, use the scraper over to the top to take off the excess polish, clean the rubber stamper part with acetone to ensure it is clean, and then put the rubber stamper down on the nail plate design with the polish to pick it up. It quickly transfers to your rubber, and you stamp it on your nail.

There are some tips for using these, First.. Be sure once you transfer to your CLEAN stamper plate, you stamp it IMMEDIATELY on your nail so the polish doesnt dry. Second, you REALLY only want to use stamping polish with these. I have a TON of colors from Konad  but honestly regular solid nail polish doesnt work too well. The METALLIC polishes DO work great (any brand).

Once you have transferred the design to your nail, wipe off the rubber with acetone and pick the next design and repeat These stampers work as good as the Konad brand, I love the mini stamper, it was hard to get small designs with the larger rubber ball of the medium stamper, so the mini rubber ball makes it simple to see where I am going on my nail. The plates are also deep enough that ALL design transfers unlike some of those other brands which make cheap plates. A good set to get you started in the world of nail stamping!

I was so relieved when I got it to find no unpleasant smell or appearance & it is in fact a pleasant soft white which seems ideal in every way including because of the resealable bag & the small size of the pastilles making it super easy to just measure out the desired quantity vs. needing to grate or cut blocks of beeswax.

I haven't yet used it as it only just arrived but I didn't want to delay posting this review in case any other shoppers might also have concerns as to which type of organic beeswax makes the most sense to try out.  I got it in order to experiment with making my own lip balm thanks to having recently found a great organic shea butter (by Wise Owl Organics) & having read that simply melting those 2 ingredients along with coconut oil can make a great lip balm to which one can also add other beneficial ingredients such as cocoa butter or flavoring as desired.  An Amazon reviewer said that microwaving in 30 seconds rounds until it's fully melted works well but I purposely don't have a microwave (given some indications that the cells of any food & possibly even containers placed in the microwave do get lastingly altered with implications for our long-term health that may not yet be sufficiently understood).  So I plan on using a glass container to put my desired ingredients into & then placing that in a pan of water that I slowly heat up until it all melts to enable proper mixing while liquid.  By purposely putting everything into my desired storage container, I'm hoping to avoid the messy clean-up a helpful Amazon reviewer warned of when working with beeswax.  I also plan on experimenting using the beeswax as an alternative to WD-40 as an outstanding contractor said it actually works way better.",1432944000,0,0,0,0,1

1713,3,"12 17, 2007",A2V1J3JT5OOZFO,B000PKKAGO,"I have used Norelco shavers for many years and prefer them to all other models I have tried. This review comes from much experience with the brand.

This Arcitec design looks fancy and works well, but gets three average stars because it really works no better than the previous non-space-age, less expensive designs. The 1050, 1060, and 1090 all operate the same, they just have a different display: none is better than the other, and don't waste money on the Cleaner accessory. It is fairly comfortable to hold (I prefer the feel of the original model because this is one is smaller), and looks fancy sitting on the counter, but it does not do a better job. It requires cleaning after each use as there is no space for the hairs. I have always cleaned my shavers after each use anyway. Unless you just want the apperance, it is not worth the extra money.

Technically: The triple-blade per round head (each cutter has three spinning blade areas) does not do any better than a double cutting blade. Kind of like a Saturday Night Live skit in the 70's, Jim Belushi said, ""Buy a triple bladed razor. For those that will believe anything"". Lift-and-cut is a ridiculous concept and a marketing ploy, but Norelco's do a nice job. Norelco went back to more diagonal openings with this model, which is good. Many other newer models have lots of little pin-holes which are worthless, as the hairs have no time to enter a small hole with shaving motion. You would have to set it directly on a hair to cut it. The less pin-holes the better.

Feel: The head design feels better on the neck, and has not caused razor-burn if I do not stretch the skin tight like I need to with the original model. It takes the same time to shave as my older unit, and I get no better results, no faster. It takes the same time to get a smooth shave, and the same persistance in some areas.

Function: It is a little bit easier to shave under the nose, above my mustache, but not a major difference. It is much harder to trim my sideburns with this unit as the heads almost cut my hair on my head above the ears the way it is shaped. Very poorly designed trimmer, so I use my older shaver for that.

Battery: Early, new battery life is good, as with most new battery devices. But, it states to not over-charge. Meaning, you need to be around when recharging to unplug it after it is charged; not good for those that shave and must go to work. The other units would shut off after charging.

Cleaner/Charger: Again, one needs to be around when it is finished to not over-charge. The cleaner is not necessary and a waste of time, money, and chemicals. I use a razor brush from an older unit, brush it out quickly over the wastebasket (one can't blow it out without getting hair dust all over the bathroom, and it can't be shaken into the wastebasket as easily as the older models), and I spray it quickly with Remington Silicone Lubricant (I can only find it at Wal-Mart, which is the only thing I ever go there for, by the way).

Overall: Buy it for looks and keep your old one in the drawer for sideburns. Nicer on the neck.

I would return it, BUT, it was a gift, AND I like the look of it. I know, I know!!

My usual eye creams do not work for me anymore as they irritate my extremely sensitive skin and cause new flare-ups.  While I found a few eye products that do not sting or cause more irritation, I am constantly searching for more and kind of obsessed right now to get more relief from itching and redness.  So among other eye products I ordered Body Tonique Repair and Replenish Facial and Body Oil.  It arrived promptly in a sealed 4 ounce plastic bottle.  The twist on and off lid is convenient for precise dispensing.  The oil is a mixture of several carrier oils with mostly oils that are found in the kitchen.  It also has a blend of essential oils that is kept a secret by manufacturer.  I was able to recognize lemon and lavender oils in it.  I applied this oil under my eyes only where I have eczema.  It was absorbed some but left a very noticeable greasy residue.  It felt okay on the lower lids but the oil got on my eye lashes and into my eyes and caused some eye irritation and blurred vision.  It made me blink constantly.  I should put less oil and even lower next time to prevent this from happening.  I already used jojoba, argan, moringa seed, rose hip and sea buckthorn oils and found them to work better and not leave so much greasy residue on my lids.

I have combination skin where I have an oily T-zone and dry cheeks. This cream is not greasy so it is OK for the oily skin and it is moisturizing so it also soothes the dry skin conditions on my face. I have not found this to be irritating like other Vitamin C creams and serums. In fact this seems to calm my skin significantly so it is not overly sensitive. If you want to look ten years younger, this is the cream to try. I find it helps with elasticity and skin resilience. I also notice I break out less and have overall clearer skin. I love this and hope it works for you too. Always test a bit on your wrist before applying.

The pluses are they are large and last a long time due to being milled (compressed) and the air bubbles take out rendering a very solid soap with heft. They have great smell and the aroma really matches a natural gardenia. They lather very well. All in all, they are very well made.

Now the small minus(es). These soaps contain small amounts of Tetrasodium EDTA & Tetrasodium Etidronate (as listed), which I developed an allergy to over the years and a small percentage of the population is like me.

To wake up with soft, glowing skin in the morning simply apply to freshly washed and toned skin each night!  Make sure you apply to face neck and decollete for best, overall results.

I always tend to use well known brands such as FHI, CHI, Sudo, etc.  However  the ease of use, functions and overall performance of the Ivation Professional Flat Iron has out performed and exceeded my expectations over my $200+ flat irons.

The touch sensitive controls are located inside the handles so no more accidentally turning the temperature down or annoying beeps because most digital displays have the controls outside where your fingers are constantly touching them.  To control the temperature and power, just lightly place your finger over the power icon or slide it up or down to control the temperature on the touch control panel.

It is truly amazing how quickly it heats up to your desired temperature.  You can watch the blue LED screen rapidly count up from 76 to 450 degrees in less than one minute.  This flat iron will glide over your hair like silk. It will leave you hair silky smooth and full of shine. Tourmaline ceramic plates produces far infra-red heat to release negative ions which reduces static and helps seal the cuticle to make your hair smoother and shiner. Tourmaline flat irons are highly recommended if you have really curly or frizzy hair.  Of course, even though using tourmaline ceramic plates can protect hair from high heat damage and breakage, you should always use a heat protection spray or product in your hair before flat ironing.

Comes with a VERY long 9 foot swivel cord.  It is extremely lightweight.

Automatically turns off if left unattended for 30 minutes.

Comes with a one-year warranty.

Granted, I don't know exactly what the right name for that specific type of chili flake is 'supposed to be' named, but I just went by the photo in the listing for this product - which looks for all the world like bright red chili flakes with no seeds.

Instead, what I got was mostly seeds, much like the type of seedy pepper flakes you see in a shaker at your local pizza joint - nothing like the photo.  I have uploaded two photos of the product I received, along side the photo that as of this writing is the phone used in the listing for this product (the one with the wide red colored band along the package top), I think it's pretty clear the products are not the same, even if all the words on the packaging are the same.  Anyway, so I put these chili flakes through the steps of creating the Hong You, pouring sizzling hot oil into a bowl on these flakes, and they did not produce any red color at all, so I went further and roasted them toasty in the pan - the flavor was OK, but it wasn't Hong You.

7438,5,"08 2, 2013",A2NYK9KWFMJV4Y,B0075ANCIK,"I love Caribbean sauces, and particularly love the diversity among them - especially between the northern Caribbean and the southern islands. This one has all of the hallmarks of a great southern sauce: more fruity and sweet, but with a respectable amount of heat.

While not among the hottest sauces from the region the flavor profile is almost evenly split between sweet and pungent. There is a bit of tang, and very little saltiness. In many respects it is one of the most unique Caribbean sauces I have tried. Part of the reason for that is the choice of fruit - the star fruit - which is enigmatic in itself. It has a subtle hint of citrus, but also is similar to fleshy fruits like apples, although not quite that either.

The tang mainly comes from the citric acid and mustard, while the turmeric both colors the sauce and gives it a slightly bitter aftertaste. What I love is the Scotch bonnets which add both flavor and heat. The heat is the slow burn type typical of those peppers, without the bite of habaneros that are often used in the southern Caribbean sauces.

Since I am on a sodium-restricted diet I especially love the low sodium levels, which come in at 60mg per serving. That is less than many other Caribbean sauces and significantly less than Mexican and Mesoamerican ones.

The sauce is thick and can be spread almost like mayonnaise. I've used it on just about every conceivable dish, including fish, eggs and even as a condiment for soups and stews. Do note that you have to refrigerate this sauce after opening it.",1375401600,0,0,0,0,1

Here, the description was not kidding when it noted that these dried lavender blossoms provide a ""subtle"" scent. It's so subtle, I basically have to put my nose within inches of it to smell anything at all.  I've always enjoyed the scent of lavender, and with a busy household I had hoped to use this as a potpourri to improve various mystery smells that can occur in a home with two kids. Unfortunately, it didn't work the way I had hoped.  While the dried blossoms are amusing to play with, as dried herbs often are, they are not exactly pretty compared to flower petal potpourri. It's also sad that the bag is not designed to be resealed. If you're careful you may be able to use the original sticky seal, but you have to be very careful opening and closing the bag.

The cotton material is very soft and inviting. I like using that first to just clean the skin and then flipping it over. The rough side is great for scrubbing. I didn't even really feel it when I was using it so that's why I ended up getting red marks. I thought it would be more of a scratchy feel but it really isn't. It is quite pleasant when you get used to it.

It is long enough to hold and work across your back without pulling or hurting your shoulders. Much better than trying to become a contortionist with a loofa, LOL!

I like the handles on either end. They make it super easy to hang on to it in the shower and also to hang it up afterwards.

The other issue I have with this is that it seems to absorb moisture. If it is hanging up in the bathroom and my husband takes a shower it will be damp. After my kids baths it is damp. Etc. It ends up never really totally drying out. (we only have the one bathroom so nowhere else to hang it). I wish it would stay dry.

I have very dry skin and make up crepes under my eyes as a result.  Yes, I've tried many other creams (specifically, every one olay has ever come out with); I've also tried setting it with different powders after watching youtube videos.  For me, powder was the worst choice.

Since most beauty products cater to oily or combination skin,  I imagine that those of us with truly dry skin are more of a minority and so it's reasonable that this won't work for a lot of people.

But if you're like me and you could probably cover your face in olive oil and think, ""damn, now my skin looks nice"", this might be for you.  It is truly the only thing I've used that doesn't make my concealer or foundation crepe.

One reviewer compared it to Vaseline, which it is definitely not.  However, I can see where she was coming from.  It's thick and oily and just what my skin needs.

The area where the water came out was small and the spray could be directed easily. It did not make a mess. It was fantastic for cleaning my teeth, which had braces.

Now that my son has some orthodontia, the dentist suggested using a WaterPik.

This thing is unbelievable. The spray comes out so fast and the spray is so wide, that it makes a huge mess. Even I, a coordinated adult, have a hard time using this without spraying down the bathroom walls, mirror, and countertop. This is a mess. I am worried the wallpaper will be ruined and will begin peeling off.

Tip: Put the device in the mouth, then turn it on. Try to use it with your mouth closed or nearly closed and shut it off before you remove it from your mouth.

After reading other customer reviews, to prevent possible leakage, we take the unit apart and dump out the water after each usage.

Do your research regarding other models available as well as this one. The customer reviews here on Amazon are eye-opening.

I wish they made the WaterPik like the original ones that lasted for many years and were easier to manage.

Update: One child has been using this for 16 months and it is still functional.

I gave this product one extra star because it has lasted me for 6 months, and I think I still have a month left in the bottle. I won't be buying it again, but feel like I should hand out another star simply because this product lasts such A LONG TIME. My usage averages twice a day, using a partial (mini) pump.

One other thing: I believe my bottle wasn't properly mixed or stirred or something. The first months of usage were terribly stinky, and left my skin so shiny with oil. Later in the bottle, the smell has eased up and I'm getting more of a matte look. Goodness knows what's going on.

For the record, my lines haven't improved and the darkness around my eyes is the same.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
I've been using Skin2Spirit eye whip for a while now, as per the directions, waiting and waiting for improvement. Every time I apply it, I increasingly dislike it. The smell is strong and unpleasant, cloyingly sweet like coffee syrup.

Skin2Spirit Eye Whip comes in a pump that pumps out too much; I try to do a half pump and am occasionally successful in getting out the right amount. It has the consistency of a thick cream. It feels like it absorbs, however, it leaves an oily sheen wherever you've applied it. I can see the line of where my eye whip ends and my facial lotion begins, as my facial lotion is oil-free.

This eye whip reeks so much my family has commented to me at different times why I 'stink' like ice cream, or coffee, or candy. Keep in mind, these comments come long after I've applied it, after it's dried. To me, it smells like coffee ice cream that's been baking in the sun all day: very sweet, cloying, pungent. Also, when I dry my hair with a hair dryer, the scent becomes strong again--heat activated--to my dismay.

My discoloration and fine lines have NOT improved with continuous use. I feel like my fine lines are actually worsening with use of this product, or else the oily sheen makes them look worse. My dark circles haven't lightened one iota.

Another thing I don't like about the product is that after I purchased it, I received an email from the owner, Kat, asking me (in other words) to give it 5 stars OR contact her to fix whatever problem I have with the eye whip. And what she really means is ""pay for more of my products"".

I've also read these long passages she's written, commenting on other people's reviews. I find her involvement in reviews unprofessional, as it comes across as her wanting to control reviews. Honest reviews can improve products because it gives companies feedback, without having to pay focus groups.

Kat also claims this eye whip works on ""99 out of 100"" people. Yeah, right. There is absolutely no science backing up this claim. I've worked in skin studies and NO company can honestly make this claim. I wish Kat would just tout the indisputable positives of the product: cruelty-free, vegan, entirely natural, paraben free, etc. instead of making more outlandish claims that aren't fact based.

I cannot recommend this product as it stands, and I wouldn't waste my money buying the unscented version either.",1391299200,0,1,0,0,0

Manuka Oil is a lot like Tea Tree Oil in that it's anti-inflammatory and antibacterial which makes it perfect to use on blemishes to speed up healing and recovery.
This Manuka Oil by Natural Beauty Limited is a 100% pure and natural essential oil and I have to say that it worked wonders on my spots.  Normally, when I have a bad reaction like the one that I had it takes weeks to heal but I started seeing results in a matter of days.  I was very consistent and used the Manuka Oil twice a day directly on the spots.  Manuka Oil is also Cicatrisant and Cytophylactic which helps promote new cell growth and healing and It think is a big reason why I saw such immediate results.
Manuka Oil and Tea Tree Oil have a lot of similarities, smell being one of them, but I feel like I had better results with the Manuka Oil than I've ever had with Tea Tree Oil.  Not sure why and it could even be because I was so consistent with the application of the Manuka Oil but whatever the reason I will be keeping the Manuka Oil on hand at all times!

I have an oily/combination complexion and I have been a huge Mary Kay 708 Bronze wearer for over ten years. I also have been using Boots No7 Primer for oil control. Going through my day with those two items was such a rewarding and frustrating experience. It was rewarding because Mary Kay was truly the only company who could match my complexion. It was frustrating because I would find myself shiny as a circus clown after just three hours into my daily routine. I was either blotting or reapplying constantly through out the day. Something had to give. After going on YouTube I came across this product and I listened to some of the rave reviews about this being a true game changer for women of color. I was skeptical but desperate so I tried it out. I can honestly say it has made a difference in my morning routine. I apply it with my fingers (after thoroughly washing my hands) and it glides on smooth. After applying my Black Opal invisible powder my skin is flawless. Now, I do not have to look in my pocket mirror at work every 30 minutes to see if my nose is glowing like Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer. Don't get me wrong it has NOT controlled my t-zone fully however, it has made a significant difference. I no longer use the Boots Primer and around lunchtime is when my skin feels a tad bit dewy so I reapply my invisible powder and I 'm good to go. I love the pump feature and a little does go a long way. The foundation (going on) has a lightweight feel to it with full coverage as the end result.  It is the only makeup I will use at this point.

Overall, I do recommend this product. If your thought process is anything like mine; I was not looking for a miracle just a better option. Real talk people; I was just ecstatic that a company is finally paying attention to our make up needs! Thanks for taking time out to read my review. I hope you found it informative.

**Update September 20, 2016**
I'm still wearing this foundation. I do not have any cons really except for the pump not working once you get down to the last amount (I just use a thin brush to get every last drop).",1464998400,0,0,0,1,0
3633,3,"05 27, 2012",A35W3JQYP0M655,B0013NB7DW,"I recently started using an electric razor after years of being a supporter of the wet shave market.  Mostly for times when it's convenient and I am in a hurry.  I remember years ago when I used an electric shaver that this Williams lectric shave worked well in making a difference in a close shave.  Picking up a bottle after all these years proves that it still does, and in my opinion a pre shave lotion is a good investment for electric razor users.  That being said, I have to say that somewhere along the line Williams changed their formula somewhat, at least in the scent, for its not the same as I remember to be sure.  Years ago this pre shave smelled as nice as any after shave did.  It was a pleasant but not too strong barber shop sort of spice scent. Now it seems to have a very weak but not at all likable scent that despite its lack of strength still seems to linger on after you shave, even with a rinse.  It reminds me very much of those cheap after shave rip offs you can find in some dollar stores that go on smelling nice for a few minutes, but then quickly turn sour and cheap...  As good as this works at stimulating your beard with a splash of alcohol and other ingredients, my recommendation is to use Afta brand pre shave which I picked up at a local pharmacy, but is also readily available here on Amazon in a two pack at the time of this writing.  In fact I have ordered some here simply because Afta's availability locally is spotty at best.  Williams seems to have a marketing hold in my neck of the woods because its also easy to find.  But I still recommend this only if you don't have any Afta available.  Afta smells much better, works as well if not better than the Willians, and unlike the Williams, to my knowledge has always been the same formula....&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mennen-Afta-Pre-Electric-original-3-FL-OZ-PACK-OF-2/dp/B000Q71HY0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mennen Afta Pre-Electric original 3 FL OZ (PACK OF 2)</a>",1338076800,0,0,1,0,0

My skin visually appears more moisturized when I use this  soap (compared to the brand that was previously in my shower). I still required lotion but could have skipped it without feeling dry and itchy.

 Linden smells like an ultra-mild lily-of-the-valley fragrance.  Peony smells... like a peony (assumption as I've never sniffed one before). I don't like the way that Angel's Trumpet smells.  It doesn't impact my rating... this just isn't the fragrance for me. I don't dislike it enough to let it go to waste so this isn't a deal breaker.

When using this soap the fragrance is stronger in the air than on my skin. It creates a relaxing experience without leaving the skin heavily perfumed.

The color of the soap is a bright green-yellow. More yellow. Peony is a soft blush/shell pink. Angel Trumpet is a yellow-beige that my kids describe as r sandy-yellow. There is a marbled like consistency to this barbiturates am overall smooth feel.  The bars have a 12/2019 expiration date on them.a

The soap does not get water-logged and squishy and that is a great indicator that the bar will last more than a week.

This is especially useful when your ankles or feet are exposed (a day on the beach, for exampe). There are a lot of critters living on the grass and on the sand and those bumps on the ankles are really bothersome.

My review:
This is a very clever idea. I really hate having to spray bug repellent on myself, especially when that's on top of my sunscreen as if I don't already feel sticky enough. The bracelets have a mild natural scent that I find pleasant. It is only starting to get warm so there are not a lot of bugs around yet, but the bracelet did keep away the few that were around. These bracelets are going to be really handy when summer arrives.

I like these springy bracelets better than the other kind that are solid stretchy bands. These are much easier to slip on and take off and are not as bothersome when they are on the wrist. The only thing that I don't like is I am not sure how long they really last. 250 hours mean ten and a half days. But after a couple of days I can't smell the scent anymore. It might still be working but how do I know? So I toss that and get a new one. It gets expensive that way though. Perhaps I will keep the two-day-olds together, and for light duty outings I will wear two of the oldies.",1458432000,0,0,0,1,0

I have been using Valentia Clear Lift Revitalizing Serum  for about three weeks. I put it on at night after my cleansing routine and before bed. After using it for several weeks, I did notice that my face was not so dry and seemed to feel healthier. Winters in northern Wisconsin can be pretty harsh on the face.  I used about 3-4 pumps and put it on my face and neck, the serum dries fast and smells really nice, not overpowering but nice. I have used several different products from Valentia and have not been disappointed yet. One of the ingredients is Argan oil, which I love for body and hair, the Gotu Kola which reduces the appearance of scars, and one that I never thought of is Licorice which can lighten problem areas of the skin such as discolorization.

A little bit of this serum goes a long way. I love how this makes my face feel and it still feels smooth when I get up in the morning. I really like it.

The mouthwash is a smaller sized bottle, but plenty to see if you like it and if it works well for you. Toothpaste and floss are full sized. This is a mouth transformation kit. If you have gum issues, or just want to take better care of your gums, this is the kit for you.

Previously I was using Sonicare Diamondclean and I was in love with it. Once I tried this Oral B toothbrush, I gave up on my Sonicare. I am 37, I smoke cigarettes, drink A LOT of energy drinks, and have braces. I NEED extra gum care and this toothbrush along with the mouthwash and toothpaste give me that. I would say that the toothbrush alone has made a big difference from when I was using the Sonicare.

I love that I can actually feel it working on my gums. It really feels like a gum massage. The smaller part of the head that moves separately is an awesome addition. That is where I feel the extra attention and the gum care. My teeth feel SO CLEAN after brushing with this one. I like that it is a more vigorous cleaning than with the Sonicare. It actually took me a long time to get used to the gentle cleaning that Sonicare toothbrushes give. I had been using Sonicare for about 10 years, so eventually I got used to it, although I never really did feel like they were really scrubbing as much as I liked. My teeth felt clean, but there was just something missing. This Oral B fills in the gap and gives me everything I am looking for, and then some. I just feel like my whole mouth is clean and fresh after using the Oral B.

The mouthwash is great for gums. I put some in my Waterpik (half mouthwash/half water) and I can tell a difference in the health and appearance of my gums. I do not get sore spots anymore and the sensitive areas are gone. Because of my braces, I tend to get gaps between my teeth down at the gumline. Debris get in there from eating and it can be painful and stay sore for a while. This mouthwash in the Waterpik really helps with all of the irritation.

The toothpaste is pretty good, although I think I will stick to my regular whitening toothpaste. I like a bit more bold mint flavor and I do need the whitening benefits due to cigarette smoking. Otherwise, it seems like a good toothpaste. It is a smoother mint flavor and seems to have almost a soothing effect on sore areas of the gum and mouth, so that is a plus when needed.

Mainly, I am just super impressed with the toothbrush. I had also tried the Oral B 7000 (black) but I much prefer this 5000 version. The 7000 was very impressive and the first Oral B to really make me switch from Sonicare, but just too loud. The 5000 here in this bundle just provides a better experience overall, without all of the noise. I thought the 7000 would end up being better, but it is not. It is sleek looking in black, but I just prefer the 5000 - I mean I really LOVE IT. The attention to the gums and the way it cleans so thoroughly and literally reaches every surface of the tooth, (even all around my braces!!!) is just amazing.

If you are going to invest in a good toothbrush, this is THE ONE to buy. if you need the extra gum care and attention this is the kit to buy. You can buy the toothbrush separate if you do not want all of the extra products, but for the price, you might as well get the bundle and try out the mouthwash, toothpaste and floss and see how you like them.

Hair mask: I have never used a hair mask that was this thick before. Most hair masks I have used before felt more just like thick conditioners to me, but this one really was so thick I had to work to scoop it from the container. I worked it through my hair and left it in for a bit while sitting in a sauna. When I rinsed it my hair was amazingly soft and silky.

Leave in conditioner: I worked this through my damp hair after using the hair mask, and it kept my hair from being too frizzy and kept it soft and smooth. My hair is naturally thick and curly, so this was an amazing change. I am in love with these products.

These sets are an amazing deal, and a great way to get a good set of products for a specific type of hair.

These look nice but that is about it for us.
I have some lavender essential oil that I love using in my home.
Was hoping for this product to smell closer to what I am already using.
They are very fragrant just not a very pleasant lavender scent.
To my kids they seemed almost soapy or perfume smelling is what they called it.
Tried them in a bath and thankfully the scent did not last because it was just not very pleasant for me.
I did manage to find a different use for these which was to leave a tiny amount in the utility room because that gets a bit musty smelling in the summer.",1504569600,0,1,0,0,0

Super Orgasm by NARS is a glowing, dispersed mash of papaya and raspberry shade with a metallic cloud of shimmer with tiny bits of chunky glitter. That might sound scary but its so wonderfully fine that it looks radiant and as if it was coming from within. For everyday makeup I reach for this no matter what Im wearing or what makeup goes on, it just looks alive even before I have my coffee without looking over done.

 This shade is sultry and sun kissed with this Hollywood Photoshop filler thing going on, it simply looks delicious. I love the whole range and Im also a fan of the NARS Sin  and Orgasm blushes, but this is the best.

I love the scent that comes off of the bar; just keeping it in the shower fills the our ensuite bathroom smell so appealing and lovely.  At first I was able to apply the bar directly to my skin, and then the course particles were brought to the surface!  It is very scratchy and painful if you are not careful.  Now we either apply to a loofah or just lather in our hands.

The lather on this bar is great as is the scent but like all bars of soap it gives you that slick feeling which we hate.  It is also very dangerous when rinsing this soap off of your body or applying directly to your feet because it makes your tub feel like an ice skating rink.  Imagine pouring hair conditioner onto your tub floor...  scary!  While I really love the scent, I find that my skin is dried out.  My husband also had a reaction that has been confirmed after repeated washings.  This particular bar makes him itchy, while the cheap Suave that makes me itchy does not.  We normally use body soaps because it just feels hygenic and simpler to use in the shower for our family.  Our favoritie brands are Aveeno, St. Ives, Dove, Johnson & Johnson, Caress, Axe for men & Old Spice... none of these leave us itchy or dry.

While I ADORE the scent and size of the bar, I just can't get past the scratchies and slippery feeling.  Hubby can't get past the itchies.  Our family will have to pass.  I do recommend it for a wonderful scent in a lavatory after it has been wet because it activates the scent.",1506729600,0,0,1,0,0

1084,4,"11 22, 2005",A2BVRKJ12P1HDY,B000A23CQM,"Hi, My name is Michael.  I live near Baton Rouge, LA.  I'm 43 and I have shaved with Norelco Electric Razors for years.  I had 3 SpectraXLs that went out within a month of shaving.  I also had a Cool Skin that went out within a month of shaving.  Norelco replaced the Spectras and I have a 8894XL that I have been shaving with for about 6 months and it works fine.  I took the money that I got back from the Cool Skin and put it towards a Smart Touch 9160XL.  I was really surprised to learn that Norelco was discontinuing the Spectra line.  8894XL is one fine shaving machine, beautiful design and well constructed, with the kinks ironed out, it's the best shaving electric razor Norelco has ever made up to now.  I say up to now.  Smart Touch is not the razor that Spectra is.  It is cheaply made and not as well constructed.  To me, Norelco has made a step backwards by discontinuing Spectra, but Smart Touch does slightly out shave Spectra and that is the main reason to buy this razor.  I have a heavy dark beard and I work 12 hour shifts at the end of my day with Smart Touch, I hardly have a shadow, AWESOME!!!!!  Something, I've never experienced with an electric razor!!!!  9160XL is good enough, unless you want to put down about $200 more for all the bells and whistles, when 9160XL shaves just as good as 9190XL.  I usually use Williams Electric Shave, but this morning I used some Pinaud Clubman Talc as a pre electric and I got the closest shave that I have ever gotten with an electric razor!!!!  Pos.- There are 3 heads on this Razor ( Something that Spectra does not have ), making for a closer shave, It has a personal comfort control with 3 settings, line bar to show you how much charge you have left, and it can be eaisly washed out after each shave, and it give the closest possible shave that you will ever  get with an electric razor.  Neg.- This razor is not of the same qualty as Spectra.  It is cheaply made and not as awesome as Spectra.  The cleaning indicator is useless.  It blinks after every shave, not when the razor needs to be cleaned.  The little travel pouch is a joke!!  The razor barely fits in it.  I almost took mine back, but I stuck with it for a couple of days and found that I really was getting the closest shave that I had ever gotten with an electric razor, so I kept mine.  Go ahead and buy this razor.  Don't waste your money on the higher priced models.  I'm sure this one shaves just as good, but be sure to save your sales slip in case it goes out.

There are a few things I look to determine the quality of brushes and they're how well the brushes are put together, how soft the bristles are, and if the bristles are thick and full.  This brush set meets all of my requirements so Im pretty pleased with this set.

This is a set of 32 brushes, with most of the brushes being eye shadow brushes.  These come in a nice roll up case that has a kind of pleather look and feel to it.  When you have the case rolled up it takes up very little room considering there are 32 brushes in it, which is great for traveling.

The metal piece that connects the handles to the bristles is called a ferrule.  Ive gotten some lower quality sets where these are poorly glued together and are loose when they arrive and easily come apart.  These came glued together very well and held up when washed.  The bristles are super soft and they are nice and thick too.  When you pull on the bristles you don't get a ton of fall out either, so this is another sign of good quality.  You may notice a bit of a smell when you open them but washing them thoroughly will get rid of that smell and its not uncommon for brushes to smell like that when brand new.  I really like the variety of brushes and this is a great set at an affordable price.

It's a bit thinner than most I use which I find makes it easier to apply evenly and with a good topcoat (I'm currently using and loving Seche Vite) and a good base coat (I use Essie) I get a long wear out of my mani.  But what really gets me with this polish is the color.  While I think the picture is pretty true to color, the shimmer is even more pretty in person.  It's a lovely purple with a light teal shimmer that is subtle, but absolutely stunning at the right angle and in the right light.  Paired with the matte finish it reminds me a lot of the look of more indie polishes, but at an affordable price.  I love, love, love this.

It's twice the thickness of most bar soaps, so that makes it harder to hold on to if you're the type who takes the bar of soap and rubs directly on to your skin. If you prefer to use a washcloth or pouf, be ready for lots of silky lather. This is how this soap brings some extra pampering to getting clean. I love that my skin doesn't feel dry, tight, or itchy after using this soap, nor does it have some overpowering artificial scent clinging to it. Though there is a faint, pleasant scent to this bar, once you're done bathing and dried off there isn't any trace of scent on your skin to interfere with any perfume or cologne you choose to wear. For anyone with sensitive skin or sensitivity to fragrances, this particular soap scent of olive oil from Pre de Provence is a great choice. The prices for the soaps here on Amazon vary against what Pre de Provence has on their website, though their website has the full lines for all their products.",1529539200,0,0,0,1,0

So he used his really expensive trays that were molded for his mouth and I used these. At the end of seven days you couldn't tell his kit cost more.

There are two teeth pre filled mouth trays per single pack.  One for the top, one for the bottom.  When you put them on you need to use your finger to sort of spread the whitener around a little.  The top tray fit my teeth great.  The lower tray seemed too small, like it didn't want to reach the front bottom of my teeth.  So it took a little adjusting to get it to fit right.

I left the trays in for thirty minutes.  By the third day my teeth were quite a bit whiter.

This will not whiten any artificial crowns or teeth that are not natural.  The first day there were sort of whitish spots on my teeth.  The next day they were gone.  The third day my teeth were definitely whiter.  Day four I accidentally slept for two hours with mine in and gums hurt like mad and my teeth were hyper sensitive.  The next day I skipped because my gums and teeth hurt.  The sixth day my teeth were sparkly.  The seventh day I was actually satisfied with my results.

This is a lower-cost version of the Norelco 1090.  The major diffference is the display. The floating heads on the Norelco electric shaver really do a good job of conforming to the curves of my face. It takes me about five minutes to shave. The shave is much more uniform than that of the Braun 3615 that I have been using for the past few years. However, the shave is not as close. Before the Braun, I used a Norelco 5801. This model is a big improvement over the old Norelco which was slow and not very close at all. The trade-off with respect to the Braun is one of a closer shave using the Braun vs. a more uniform shave with the new Norelco.

Maintenance:
The clippings are collected in pockets under the shaving heads, This is an advantage in that the clippings are not scattered over the bathroom sink as they are with some electric razors. The pockets have to be cleaned out every shave or two. This is not a big problem. It only takes a few seconds. The manual indicates that the RQ10 shaving head assembly must be replaced every year. Amazon offers the RQ10 for $35. By contrast the Braun cutter and foil assembly which lasts for about one year sells on Amazon for around $24.

PS: I found that I had to replace the head assembly after 6 months. I am now using a Remington Flex 360 Rotary Shaver which has a design similiar to the Norelco but provides a faster, closer shave, and costs a lot less.",1197331200,0,0,0,1,0

Plus, the lack of alcohol helps me deal with chronic dry mouth issues (alcohol rinses and mouthwashes make dry mouth much worse).

But how a rinse tastes is important since you'll be tasting it for some time after use. This was overly sweet rather than ""fresh mint"" tasting like other rinses (such as ACT). The aftertaste remained sweet to the point where it was unpleasant.

I'm was concerned about the potential for tooth staining. I've not had any issues with that so far with this rinse, but it was a concern.

I'm pretty new to stamping and don't have a lot of basis for comparison, but it seems as if maybe the etching is shallower on this than the two other plates I have. I should note I have just been using regular polish. So perhaps it's time to invest in real stamping polish and see if that makes a difference. Because I DO really like the design.",1456272000,1,0,0,0,0

The shaving peformance is fine for me -- not as close as a wet shave but that's a good thing for me personally because the closeness of wet shaves makes my face break out.  Every 3-7 years I buy a new Norelco and they get incrementally better each time.

I'm writing to warn about one feature.  Every shaver I'd had up to this one had a physical slider switch to turn it on and off.  This models has a push button.  This means you can't tell BY TOUCH whether it's on or off.  This is critical for me because I usually shave in the car (sitting in traffic) with the stereo blaring and I can't hear the shaver (especially since the newer models are pretty quiet).  I turn it on and off a lot as traffic conditions change.

Further, when the battery is low, my previous shavers would just run slower and slower until they came to a gradual stop.  This one slows slightly (imperceptably to me, really) and then just ""falls off the cliff"" and stops cold.  So you don't get any warning really that it's about to run out -- if I knew it was running down, then I'd shave a lot faster!

And this is where the tactile power switch feedback is important:  if the battery's totally drained, but I'm not done yet, I'll leave it off for a minute and then turn it on for 5-10 seconds of shaving before it dies again.  With the push-button power control this is really confusing because you're never really sure what's on and off.  It turns out the the power button is like a pulse that gets sent to an internal microcontroller (I'm guessing), so after it's been off for a while the power ""position"" doesn't matter, it's really off.  You just push to reboot the thing.

So, my 7825XL was robbed out of my car last night and I'm buying another one of these, so I guess that's an endorsement.  But I'm bumping up to the next higher model with better battery status indication ...",1108339200,0,0,0,1,0

This Honey Bee Smooth bath and body scrub is one of those products that is all natural (its even edible) and it can be used as a scrub, cleanser or mask. As a matter of fact, it only contains three ingredients, which is awesome. Its a little messy when using it because the honey melts and runs down your arm (and leaves you sticky if you don't wipe up good afterward), but its worth it since the scrub is so amazing!

One thing about this scrub is that the brown sugar in it, which is what does the actual scrubbing/exfoliating, settles on the bottom of the container. Its darker on the bottom because thats where the brown sugar is (mine isn't so bad now, since Ive been using it and kind of mixing it as I use it). So, youll need to mix it up each time you use it or dig your fingers down to the bottom (thats what I do) to get some of that brown sugar goodness!

Speaking of which, brown sugar is a lot more grainy and fine in texture than I expected. I actually really like the texture of it, though, and I love how it feels on my skin. Its not extremely abrasive, which I like because I have sensitive skin. It does a great job of exfoliating and removing dead skin cells. I personally only use this on my face to help with breakouts and moisturization. I often exfoliate with it, leave it on for 5 - 10 minutes, and then rinse off. It makes my skin feel really soft. You don't need a lot either. I use maybe a teaspoon or so with each use.

Its gentle enough to use daily and, best of all, the product tastes delicious!! After all, it is just honey, brown sugar and vitamin E. If you wanted to, you could use it as a natural sweetener. It smells just like honey, too. Really yummy stuff!

This is a one ounce glass bottle, pump action. Clear serum.

Though I can't know what it does on a cellular level, really, I do know that using Oz products (along with other good skin care products and eating healthfully, along with exercise and good sleep, and genes - really, the stuff we put on our faces is only a part of good skin care) keeps my skin looking good. Many people can't tell my age, and that means I'm doing something right. So since Oz Naturals is also reasonably priced (under $18 at time of this reveiw), I feel good about purchasing it.

What I wish is that it were easier to pump - it kind of jets out so it's more difficult to control how much you want.

This is not a ""luxe feel"" type of serum, so be aware of that. It feels more dry (though not drying to your skin-there's just no sits-on-top-of-skin thicker feel that some serums have) after you put it on rather than with that emollient feeling some serums have. That's probably also because of the hydraulic acid quality in it. It's a serum blend of hydraulic acid, vitamin E, retinol, and other ingredients.

1721,3,"12 15, 2007",A2V1J3JT5OOZFO,B000PKNPES,"I have used Norelco shavers for many years and prefer them to all other models I have tried.  This review comes from much experience with the brand.

This Arcitec design looks fancy and works well, but gets three average stars because it really works no better than the previous non-space-age, less expensive designs.  The 1050, 1060, and 1090 all operate the same, they just have a different display: none is better than the other, and don't waste money on the Cleaner accessory.  It is fairly comfortable to hold (I prefer the feel of the original model because this is one is smaller), and looks fancy sitting on the counter, but it does not do a better job.  It requires cleaning after each use as there is no space for the hairs.  I have always cleaned my shavers after each use anyway.  Unless you just want the apperance, it is not worth the extra money.

Technically:  The triple-blade per round head (each cutter has three spinning blade areas) does not do any better than a double cutting blade.  Kind of like a Saturday Night Live skit in the 70's, Jim Belushi said,  ""Buy a triple bladed razor.  For those that will believe anything"".  Lift-and-cut is a ridiculous concept and a marketing ploy, but Norelco's do a nice job.  Norelco went back to more diagonal openings with this model, which is good.  Many other newer models have lots of little pin-holes which are worthless, as the hairs have no time to enter a small hole with shaving motion.  You would have to set it directly on a hair to cut it.  The less pin-holes the better.

Feel:  The head design feels better on the neck, and has not caused razor-burn if I do not stretch the skin tight like I need to with the original model.  It takes the same time to shave as my older unit, and I get no better results, no faster.  It takes the same time to get a smooth shave, and the same persistance in some areas.

Function:  It is a little bit easier to shave under the nose, above my mustache, but not a major difference.  It is much harder to trim my sideburns with this unit as the heads almost cut my hair on my head above the ears the way it is shaped.  Very poorly designed trimmer, so I use my older shaver for that.

Battery:  Early, new battery life is good, as with most new battery devices.  But, it states to not over-charge.  Meaning, you need to be around when recharging to unplug it after it is charged; not good for those that shave and must go to work.  The other units would shut off after charging.

Cleaner/Charger:  Again, one needs to be around when it is finished to not over-charge.  The cleaner is not necessary and a waste of time, money, and chemicals.  I use a razor brush from an older unit, brush it out quickly over the wastebasket (one can't blow it out without getting hair dust all over the bathroom, and it can't be shaken into the wastebasket as easily as the older models), and I spray it quickly with Remington Silicone Lubricant (I can only find it at Wal-Mart, which is the only thing I ever go there for, by the way).

Overall: Buy it for looks and keep your old one in the drawer for sideburns.  Nicer on the neck.

I would return it, BUT, it was a gift, AND I like the look of it.  I know, I know!!

I purchased a Braun 9595 through J&R on Amazon, and it has a 60 day trial return guarantee.  This is the first micro-screen razor I have used and it is better in all respects to the Norelco Arcitec except for the fancy styling.  It is fast and comfortable, and my face feels razor smooth.  I was able to return the Arcitec and am really happy with this Braun 9595 model.",1197676800,0,0,1,0,0

2613,4,"12 16, 2007",A6VPK7X53QNAQ,B000V5Z4J6,"The hardest thing about the Philips UV Sanitizer was getting the package to open as it was extremely difficult to cut through the clear plastic packaging. After that it was a breeze, place the brush heads inside the stainless steel lined chamber - the bristles should face the UV bulb - and plug it in and turn it on. The UV bulb comes on and the sanitizer does the rest. In about ten minutes, your brush heads are germ free. The bulb will only turn on when the unit is closed as a safety measure. When it is closed the translucent window down the front shows that the bulb is on. It's not possible to ""see"" any results, but it's the clinical way of sanitizing any equipment. You use this sanitizer with Philips Sonicare Elite or Pro or some Oral B brush heads with an adaptor. So the product is designed well and works as advertised which is the reason for the 4 star rating.

However, if you're thinking whether buying the sanitizer is worth it, here's my take. The Philips website talks about the fact that studies have shown that there are more than one hundred million microorganisms can be found on the brush heads of even healthy individuals. The website also says that bacteria thrive in moist environments and live up to 48 hours even on dry brush heads. When I put my brush head into this sanitizer the UV radiation does the work to kill 99% of the bacteria, however my brush head remains moist till I take it out for next time since it's inside the chamber and does not get a chance to dry off completely. That is probably not a very good thing as per Philips own website which asserts the bacteria thrive in moist environments. So will the sanitizer improve my oral health? I am not sure.

Also the sanitizer takes quite a bit of space than simply having just a toothbrush in its charger on the sink. Plus there is one more electric cord in addition to your toothbrush charger cord plugged into the outlet which clutters up the bathroom. If you ask me, If I hadn't received this product as a promotion I would not buy it.",1197763200,0,0,0,1,0

Simply Beautiful Marvel 10 Effects - 10 In 1 Keratin Based Leave-In Hair Treatment - 250ml works like a charm, leaving my hair soft, full, and manageable. When hair is properly conditioned, it not only looks better and feels better, it holds its style better and longer. I used Marvel 10 Effects with a blow dryer and also with just letting my hair dry naturally--great results either way. Well-conditioned hair also requires less styling products to create and keep a style in place. Your hair will look healthier and be so much more touchable with less hairspray and other styling products ""gooping"" it up. I found the scent to be somewhat strong, but it diminished after a while. This is a non-greasy, effective conditioner which did not leave my fine hair flat.

Luckily, I read the back before even hopping into the shower.  Now, I think the scent may be polarizing. For me, it translated as ""pleasant"" and ""clean"" (I thought it smelled like a blend of citrus and mint, which I found to be a very refreshing fragrance). I think because I gravitate towards the uncommon, this registered as very likeable. Now, I definitely used WAY too much the first time. (I think I just enjoyed the texture and the experience. LOL!) So, just be careful of that. Finally, it is easy to distribute and rinsed super clean. My only concern is any potential rust from the canister. I usually leave my shampoo and conditioner in the shower area ... but I was worried that this container could stain my tub/shower (I had done this accidentally with a shave cream many years ago). So, I find myself taking this into the shower and carrying it out of the shower ... and occasionally forgetting it, wrapping a towel around me and going to grab it. I guess, I'm flummoxed by metal containers in the shower.

Understand, the conditioning aspect is very light (so as to allow for volume and movement), so if you have damaged hair, this may not be the best choice. However, it certainly does leave plenty of bounce. By all means, it does what it claims!",1407801600,0,0,0,1,0

This made it to the fourth day without a chip and by the fifth day had to be removed do to chipping and peeling.  This is an excellent record for my polish to last this long.

This went on smoothly without streaks.  I love the wide brush so that with just three strokes there is a smooth even coat on my nail.  I enjoy the unique shape of the bottles too.

This won't equal the life of gel nail polish but it's a longer life polish than others I've used so I will continue to use this.",1511827200,0,0,0,0,1

I have another one that I have used about two to three times because it takes longer then the regular hair straightener so I have it in case of a emergency. My daughter tried the other one and did not like it but we used this one and it worked great and fast.
I should let you know that my daughter was in beauty school and they had her like a puppet doing stuff to her hair and so she got really bad heat damage that all her curls were gone. But I have been putting coconut and argan oil so it can recuperate and its been about 6 months and several hair cuts. Now her hair is better and you will see on the photos.

This is a great product it does heat up fast which is great. I first combed her hair then I passed the straightener about twice on the same hair and we loved that her hair did not smell burnt and it grabbed great on the hair.
She has really thick curly hair so I had to do sections by section but it took about 15 to 30 minutes when she takes about 1 hour to 1 1/2 hours with a regular straightener.

Overall we do love this straightener and will continue using it. I also like that it has a shut off if you forget to shut it off and  the brush is ceramic and uses PTC for its heating.

8205,4,"06 30, 2016",ARCCGXYM82JRG,B00SUC9SQW,"These are Good for our needs.  I use nail wraps for more than just nails.

My son has a medical device (dex cgm) that includes a sensor attached to his body that is a little bigger than the larger nail wraps.  It gets boring and it's nice to change up how it looks a bit.  The larger nail wraps do a great job of changing it up and adding a little fun at times to the dull medical device.

These nail wraps are a little smaller then others we've had so they don't  cover the entire sensor quite as thoroughly as others we've used, but it's decent.

Nail wraps work much better than stickers or things like that.  Nail wraps look more like they are painted on, like they belong there vs stickers.  Plus this devices gets a lot of wear and sticks don't last and look awful quickly.  We also typically cover the sensor with a clear tape and it sticks to  stickers and so even covered they come off as soon as the tape is removed.  Nail wraps, are more oa nail polish and last a long time - they can last a few months if you don't decided the change it sooner.

While the Tattify wraps are a little small, I LOVE that they offer a lot of boy and make teen appropriate designs.  The hard part of changing the look of medical devices has always been finding designs that a boy and especially a mail teen likes.

The second use - we have a teen daughter.  Our son gets the bigger ones for his sensor, our daughter gets the small ones for her nails.  It's a great double use and win win all around.

The nautical design has a good masculinity (but also nice for girls) to it.

This review is for Maximum Cavity Protection for growing adult teeth, which is a new concept.  The toothpaste comes in a stand up container that has a press style pump.  You press the pump to express toothpaste, which is a sparkly green colored gel.

The flavor is mild bubble fruit and that is exactly the way the toothpaste tastes, with just a hint of mint added.  The toothpaste offers maximum cavity protection with anticavity  0.24% fluoride.  It promises to fortify weak spots on enamel and helps to reduce plaque buildup with regular brushing.  It also freshens breathe.  It does not have whitening properties, which is the only reason I deducted a star.  My college age daughter brushes with  whitening toothpaste,  so she will brush with this toothpaste first, for cavity protection, to reduce plaque buildup, and to fortify weak spots on enamel, then finish with a whitening toothpaste (like Colgate Optic White) or mouthwash, for whitening benefits.

The toothpaste tastes good and offers some serious benefits for growing adult teeth.  Perfect for my 19 year old daughter!",1470268800,0,0,0,1,0

Because there was so much mud in an 11 pound container, I decided to transfer some into little jars and some plastic zip lock bags.

I recently reviewed Dead Sea Mud from a different company and of course it wasn't 11 pounds worth of it but I got to try it for the first time.

That particular mud left a tingling prickly sensation while the mask was drying on my face, so I didn't want to keep it on for too long but I did leave it on for 15 minutes.

The texture in the Adovia mud mask is creamier then the other mud mask I had previously tried on.

I felt no tingling or prickling whatsoever with the Adovia mud mask.
With the other one, after application, I had to put moisturizer on to get some of the redness down. Although it left my skin soft.
But the experience that I just received with this mud mask from the Adovia was beyond my expectations. My face had no redness and it was baby bottom soft if you know what I mean. Lol
All I can say was wow! I did apply my coconut oil afterwards because that is my routine but in reality after the mask I did not need moisturizing. It felt incredible I couldn't stop touching my face.

While I have thankfully not had one of the latter to deal with recently, I have tried the strips for cold sensitivity and had quite good results. I got about a week of reduced pain, this certainly would be very helpful for situations that I regularly deal with like a damaged filling or chipped tooth, which don't quite rise to the level of a dental emergency but are certainly uncomfortable to live with. I'm not sure I would use it routinely just for sensitivity but it would be helpful if I knew I was going to be doing something like having ice cream or something else where the sensitivity is more of an issue.",1412467200,0,0,0,0,1

As a 36-year-old mother of a toddler, I've definitely seen some additional fine lines cropping up in the last year. My skin also just seems to feel a little more dull. I've only been using this serum for a week, but I have already noticed a dramatic difference in the fine lines around my mouth and at the corners of my eyes.

I have been using the retinol moisturizer from this line for about six weeks though, and I think that is part of why I am seeing faster results by adding the serum into the combination. What I do is cleanse, use a toner to open my pores and get me ready for a serum, apply the serum, brush my hair while I wait for it to dry, and then add moisturizer. I repeat the process in the morning and evening, using a night cream and an eye cream at bedtime, and I can tell I am seeing great results because I actually forgot and stopped doing anything besides cleansing and moisturizing for about a week and half around the holidays, and I looked much more tired. As soon as I picked up my routine again, and added this retinal serum for additional boost, the results came back and then some.

I will caution that I have read that ladies who are pregnant or trying to become so should not use retinal treatments during that particular time because the vitamin A does sink into your skin and is absorbed into your system, and the book I read about fertility and becoming pregnant said that because you don't know how much of the vitamin A has sunk into your skin, it's hard to regulate the exact quantity of this nutrient, and during a delicate time such as pregnancy, you need to be a little bit more regimented. However, I began using the retinol moisturizer after I finished nursing, and since pregnancy and nursing does really take a lot of nutrients from you and I was seeing the negative result of that on my skin, I would highly recommend the product for getting back to yourself after pregnancy, childbirth and nursing.",1419984000,0,0,0,0,1

The brush itself is quite a step up from the professional grade brush I bought from my dentist about 10 years ago.  There are extra modes and the smart guide timer (which works wirelessly) is a great feedback mechanism that times me at 30 seconds per side and also indicates if I am pressing too hard.  It's great feedback and the visual actually makes the time to brush go by quicker.

It's easy to think of it as a gimmick, but the smart guide is truly smart and a great way to get feedback and build better habits.

I use my hands a lot and rarely wear gloves (except when doing yardwork because bugs actually bite! plus they are creepy! ha ha!) So my nail polish is constantly chipping. For years I stuck with light polishes (frosty white is my favorite!) mainly because the chips are harder to see. I recently have been exploring uv gel polishes and do like them for their wear, but what a pain to soak that crap off. I swear the time I save not polishing them every other day is lost soaking and scraping that stuff off. I do like it though. Sometimes, however, I just want regular polish that is simple to remove. This Essie stuff is really nice.

They call it ""gel"" and I am not sure how it is different from other polishes, but it does not need a UV light. I am not good enough at chemistry to know the difference between paint and enamel and lacquer and all that. This applies just like traditional polish. I really like that the top coat is included. This way I know that the formulas ""match"" and the top coat will adhere well to the color. And it does. If you have ever used top coat that doesn't really belong with a polish, you know it can almost dissolve the undercolor or something and your clear bottle and brush is now pink (or red or whatever.) This belongs together. And the combination of 2 coats of color and one topcoat really does last for me for a few days.

I am pleased to say that I love mango butter! When first taking out the mango butter it was harder than expected; I thought that it would be softer, more like body butter. But once you get it warmed up, it is extremely smooth and there is no graininess to the mango butter. I like how there is virtually no scent. This makes it easier for me to mix in essential oils into it. In winter my face gets really dry and start to peel, for the most part regular lotions from store never seem to work because of all the chemicals. I usually use cocoa and shea butter to keep my face is smooth and peel free. But now I can add mango butter with my creams. I mix cocoa, shea and mango butter with glycerin and various essential oils to make my own body cream, and the cream makes my skin feel extremely moisturized and smooth, I sometimes use just the pure mango butter and put it on my lips to make it extra smooth.

I've bought several packs now both in white and black.  I will say that I kind of like the white a bit better but the black are so pretty and I always get lots of compliments! They are definitely a great alternative to the super expensive name brand ones which Ive actually found do not last nearly as long.  The Bluezoo brand lasts for about a week.  They look great on and didn't give me a rash or anything and I have very sensitive skin. This product is amazing. Theyre great for raves or parties or outdoor music festivals and they are super  long lasting too especially when you are all sweaty from dancing  which is a big huge bonus. . They do last 2-3 days longer than the name brand tattoos,  but do become dull or more silvery over time. The application and removal were really easy -- just be sure to follow the directions and you really shouldn't have a problem at all. Hand sanitizer and / or baby wipes really aid in getting any and all residue off of your skin.

I literally had buy these when I saw them  - they look like actual hennaand I love that they are half the price of other tattoos, and I LOVE the look. Makes everyone double take. They don't feel pre-teen or cheesy and they can mimic the look of jewelry if you don't want to be too adventurous.
Apply them on clean dry skin, try not to scrub at them and it keeps looking fresh for over forty eight hours longer than other brands I have tried.

I think these are such a cute idea for a special event or to complement a nice tan! I decided to wear them like jewelry and I got a ton of complements - I wasn't expecting a long wear time but for me they lasted straight through my shower (about 2 days after application), not once but twice. I wore one on both of my inner wrists, one on my inner forearm and one under my upper back and was surprised that I couldn't feel them or notice any type of crunching or bunching up of the material. I have quite dry skin and don't know if this helped with the wear time but rubbing the skin and washing my hands had no effect on the tattoo at all.

Overall for the price I think they are a totally cute idea and I will definitely keep wearing one or two at a time until the package is done. I have shared them with my friends kids and they just raved about them.  Not sure what I will do with the really large ones. but I would totally say to give them a try! They're quite cute and very well worth it - they last a long time and they're high quality. I'll definitely be trying them in metallic as well.  These make incredible stocking suffers and great additions to birthday or Christmas presents  the fact that they come off so easily is wonderful because once you go back to work it looks a little unprofessional to be running around with these all over your arms  I haven't had an opportunity to use them on my legs or calves  I don't really think theyd look very good on that part of the body but I think putting them on the top of the foot could be a good way to wear them.

Overall  great buy especially for the price  I highly recommend!

First, read the instructions.  Start off with low pressure as this little pump can shoot out quite an aquatic projectile!  Just make sure you have the nozzle turned AWAY from your eyes.  NEVER let this anywhere near your eyes.  Once you have regulated the flow to where you want it, you are ready to enter a whole new world of oral health!

This little Godsend also comes with a tongue cleaner.  After you give yourself a good oral cleansing, you and your dentist will have entered into a new phase of your oral health partnership.  This is EXCELLENT for your tongue, teeth and gums and does a very thorough job.

I like the fact it alerts me to change quadrants in my mouth, especially if I am zoning and/or listening to the news on tv - lol!

Honestly, I didn't need the extras that come with this kit because I already have them, but it certainly doesn't hurt to add to the inventory.  The toothbrush would have been enough for me, BUT I think this is a terrific gift idea to give to someone just learning how to really care for their teeth.  I mean, I didn't use floss for years because no one explained to me why it was important to use it.

4426,4,"08 9, 2009",ADLVFFE4VBT8,B002C741NG,"For more than one reason, I haven't seen the insides of a hair-cuttery in more than a decade. Flowbee was my trusted hair-management solution for all these years until I had the opportunity to try Norelco's 'Power Hair Clipper', model QC5055.

I am unlikely to ever return to Flowbee now because the QC5055 does the job much faster, it's less noisy and delivers a much better quality haircut.

Operation:

Once charged, all you need to do is attach the proper comb (see below), select the desired hair length and proceed with cutting.

Hair-cutting tends to be a borderline traumatic experience for me - I'm a long hair type person - but this was a near-painless experience. I am looking forward to more future haircuts. It goes fast, smooth and easy. From time to time, you may have to clean the comb and/or the clipping attachment but that can be done quickly and easily. My wife gave me a near-professional-quality haircut in about 10-15 minutes and finished me with sufficient momentum to place our 12 yr. son under the cutter and 'even him out' as well.

What you get:

- The hair clipper body hosting the rechargeable batteries.
- The clipping attachment
- Stainless steel, self-sharpening cutting blades
- Large comb
- Small comb
- Stubble comb
- Charger
- Cleaning brush
- English/Spanish instructions
- Registration card with $20 coupon offer

Some specs:

- Battery life is rated at about 35 minutes.
- Charge time is 10 hours.
- Cuts hair from .12 in./3 mm to 1.61 in./41 mm.
- 15 length settings between the 3 combs (seven on each of the large and small combs plus the stubble comb)

Returns and warranties:

There's a 45-day money back guarantee promise if the customer can provide proof of purchase and ships the item, insured, to Norelco at own expense.

The 2-year warranty promises to replace defective products for as long as the customer didn't do anything 'unreasonable' and he/she paid for shipping the item to Norelco, preferably insured. Proof of purchase, of course, is a must.

What I liked:

Other than the surprising ease of use and operation and the quality of the haircut, I liked the easy cleaning and maintenance and the fact that, if needed, it can operate in a 'corded' mode. The comfortable, rubberized grip makes hair cutting, even self-cutting easy and efficient.

The brief manual is written in good English and is very good at illustrating cleaning and assembly and has very good advice on maintenance, preserving battery life and even some haircutting tips.

Issues:

My big problem and the only one so far is the lack of some case or storage box. With so many parts of which some are small and/or fragile, not providing some way to store them, protect them and keeping them organized is inexcusable.

Rating:

This would have been an easy 5-star if it came with a case. Since it doesn't, it gets 4.

I still recommend the QC5055 most highly but be prepared to supply your own box or pouch - I did - or risk losing combs or the cleaning tools or maybe misplace the essential charger.",1249776000,0,0,0,1,0

Hard to choose so I picked the one I am most familiar with, ""So Pretty"" which contains ylang ylang, geranium, lavender and lemon oil. The bath bomb has an off white color. The rose petals are yet visible until you drop the bath bomb in water for a couple seconds. The petals are are not whole pieces but in smaller chunks. The amount of the rose petals are not a lot either which was kind of disappointing.
As for the scent of the bath bomb from the essential oil, it was very soothing and pleasing. There is no synthetic fragrance so the scent was very naturally and not overwhelming at all. I really enjoy sitting in the tub for longer than usual.

After getting out of the tub, I immediately regretted my decision so I stayed a little longer. When I got out of the tub for good I wrapped myself up and I notice the floral scent in my hair. I was so delighted. That was a good indulgence :)

Since becoming a parent I have been fairly lazy with my skin care routine. I started to use just a face wipe at night instead of soap and water.

I pulled out my Clarisonic (which I highly recommend) to wash my face each day. I started to take time with my with my skincare routine. Applying the SK-II Cellumination before applying my moisturizer.  You use the dropper to get a a drop or two of the serum out of the bottle. The serum is a white pearly color.

What I didn't like was that the scent of this was a little strong after a while. I initially just let this sit around so I could enjoy its scent, as it's initially quite pleasant, but after a while the scent can build up and become a bit overwhelming. This is of course diminished some when you use it as actual soap rather than for its scent (meaning that you may not want to use this to scent a drawer) but people with very sensitive noses may want to be cautious here. The other thing is that this did dry my skin out and while this wouldn't be an issue for my boyfriend, my skin tends to dry out easily - especially around autumn - so it's a little bit of a deal breaker for me.

The cream has a consistency that is hard to describe but is just right, foams easily, washes off easily, leaves the skin supple and soft and with a scent so delicious that I keep smelling myself for hours after the shower, it's just gorgeous beyond description. I also love the bamboo and rhubarb scents, respectively, they're just as good and some people might actually prefer one or the other to hibiscus, but for my taste hibiscus is sheer perfection when it comes to fragrance. By the way, I don't really know what hibiscus smells like, this definitely smells nothing like hibiscus tea, which was the only hibiscus scent I ever had a chance to try but it's a classy, elegant fragrance that just makes you appreciate life.

5347,3,"01 23, 2015",A6VPK7X53QNAQ,B00L1BLGSW,"This essence is part of the SK-II line of products and is classified under ""Radiance"" and claims that it can give one wrinkle free and brighter skin if used regularly.

Given that this is an expensive product line that I've seen at Amazon, Sephora, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom and Bloomingdales and if I remember correctly recently at Costco, I was curious to find out some history and benefits before using it on my face. I have pretty good skin for my age by just following a very simple regimen of cleansing, moisturizing with natural creams, and not using too much make up, taking vitamins and drinking adequate water. Now as I age, I have seen some reduction in elasticity of skin so I want to start using something for my face on a more regular basis. But I want to pick the right one that I can use over time without any ill effects or I'd rather go ""au naturale"". So bear with me as I take you through my process of research about this product.

From Wikipedia I read that this product line SK-II was born out of ""Secret Key"", a skincare line developed by Japanese scientists during the 1970s who were looking into using more naturally derived ingredients. While observing workers at a sake brewery, they observed that elderly workers had wrinkled faces that showed their age, but their hands were smooth, clear and younger looking from years of submerging their hands in the fermented yeast. After much research and development, the strain of naturally-occurring yeast was isolated for use. ""Secret Key"" was launched as ""SK-II"" in December 1980.

Given the success of their water based essence (not this product) that was called ""Miracle Water""  they got noticed and P&G acquired them. In 2006, there was some controversy about some unsafe ingredients in the formulation and their formulation has since changed from what I can tell from reviews on other sites. They have also branched out into various other essences, lotions, moisturizers etc given the success of the original products. This Cellumination essence is relatively new and placed under the ""Radiance"" category of products.

It is a pearly white lotion, with a high concentration of Pitera - the yeast strain that produces youthful skin. Other ingredients are listed below (at the end of the review) and include some ingredients found in similar essences from other brands to rejuvenate, hydrate and plump up the skin. I've been looking at other ingredient lists for some other essences (L'Occitane, L'Oreal, Juice Beauty etc.) and find some common ingredients but the composition is different in all.

This essence has Nylon-12 higher up in the list but this is not particularly worrying as it is a filler that stays on the surface of the skin and produces ""plump"" skin. But the high concentration of Niacinamide (Vitamin B3) caused me to wonder as it is the 2nd active ingredient after Pitera. Although it increases skin cell circulation and prevents loss of water from skin, it is also used to treat breakouts, red bumps and uneven skin conditions. This information is from a large scale study of women between 40 and 60 - done by guess who - yes, P&G.

 When I went back to the product reviews for this essence on different makeup sites, I found that some users - roughly 20%-25% reported red bumps on the skin when starting to use this product. Some stopped right away thinking they were getting an acne attack but others persisted and after some time the breakouts went away. Does Pitera initially cause the skin to break out and is this why Niacinamide is present in a higher concentration to minimize these breakouts? Some users said it was natural to get breakouts while the skin was ""getting used"" to Pitera and it was possible even for dry or combination skin people to get a breakout. Hmmmmm. NOTE: Some further information I've read says that Niacinamide reacts with Vitamin C based serums (Hyaluronic Acid) and is not good for your face, in UV light of daytime it actually forms hydrogen peroxide, so until I research further, I will not be using my hyaluronic acid based moisturizer any more on top of this essence.

There is also some reporting that there are breakouts if you stop using the essence. But then again, others said they didn't get them. Every one's skin is a little different, so I don't know what will happen if I stop using it.

Moving on, other ingredients are glycols, silicone based ingredients, nylon, etc. that are all used as plumpers, fillers and hydrate skin. I have to admit I am a little scared as I have started using this essence as I don't want to get a breakout. I notice a smoothness and don't see a breakout yet but I am not using it in the night as I want to let my skin breathe. Having used some other serums I don't see a huge difference yet. I do like the simple dropper type dispenser as you don't waste any product. I directly squeeze a drop on each cheek and pat in using just the finger tips.

This review/rating will be updated upon any progress. As per the product page, any longer term benefits will not be visible before 14 days and as per other users at about 2 month mark. If I am to use this essence as my regular product I need to see bigger benefits to justify the high price. Given that it will probably last 3-4 months, it is still $40 per month. I need to see the radiance that allows me to stop using any powders or foundation to even out my skin tone, I could then consider buying this pricey product on a regular basis.

Pitera or GFF is the main ingredient in this essence, many other sellers are selling GFF concentrate on Amazon, some products have great reviews. Often, these vendors give away several free products or extremely discounted products to garner those reviews so read all information carefully, especially as these are facial products. Next I have the ingredients in this essence and my weekly updates will be down below.

Ingredients (the ingredients on package differ from those listed on website, some key ingredients like rice bran oil etc are now missing and some ingredients like prunus fruit extract are added):
Water, Galactomyces Ferment Filtrate (Pitera the miracle ingredient!), Niacinamide, Butylene Glycol, Triethylhexanoin, glycerine, Nylon-12, Pentylene Glycol,Phytosteryl Lauroyl Glutamate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Boron Nitride, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride,  Panthenol, PEG-20 Sorbitan Cocoate, Mica, Titanium Dioxide, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Phenoxyethanol, PEG-11 Mehtyl Ehter Dimethicone, Polyacyrlamide, Benzyl Alcohol, Undecylenoyl Phenylalanine, Aminomethyl Propanol, C-13 14 Isoparaffin, Disodium EDTA, Hexyldecanol, Sodium Benzoate, Xantham gum, Laureth 7, Parfum, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Methylparaben, Prunus Mume Fruit Extract, Limonene, Citronellol, Tocopherol.

1 week update: I did not get a breakout yet, and have switched to using 2 times daily - in morning and at night before bed. I notice a slight dryness after applying serum so I apply a natural moisturizer on top. In the day time I apply serum, moisturizer and some powder. The serum caused a slight redness on my cheeks so I have to apply powder to even out the tone. My skin does not seem significantly smoother yet, and it's definitely not any more radiant yet.
If you're going from no serum or similar creams to this product you may see better results. I had been using another serum lately, that is just 1/5th the price of this serum so my skin had already started feeling smoother. This serum has maintained that effect, but since it's slightly drying, right now my skin does not seem any more radiant. Stay tuned for another update after a few days.

3 week update: I notice a slight smoothness in my skin, but nothing remarkable yet over other serums that I was using previously. There have been no breakouts and no redness. Immediately after application my skin feels smoother and plumper but I need that to last through the day to show me that there is an actual difference in my skin. As per most reports, it takes 2 months to start noticing benefits, so I will continue to update.

5 week update: At the 4 week mark I started getting some rough and dry patches on my cheeks near the chin and on my forehead. I have been using this essence at least once a day after I cleanse my face, usually in the night but sometimes during the day too, so I am not sure where the dryness is coming from. I have not changed anything else. Still using the same products on top of the essence. The temperatures are a bit warmer now and the rest of my body is less itchy and dry, so I am not sure why my face is getting dry and flaky. My skin feels smooth after applying this essence but also dries out so I have to apply something on top. I will continue to use and hope this flaky skin clears away. However, it is not giving me any confidence in buying this super expensive product in the future.",1421971200,0,0,1,0,0

The mask smells really nice, it is a lighter and more natural smelling coconut scent than a lot of coconut scented hair products which makes me feel like it is less chemical fragrance and has more real ingredients. I usually use Argan oil hair masks, generally I do a deep conditioning treatment about once a week to help fight off split ends and breakage from over styling and dying. I have been hearing a lot lately about how wonderful coconut oil is for repairing and strengthening hair and so really wanted to try this mask, especially since I've always gotten great results with Radha's products. I found this mask to be much thinner than what I'm used to, thinner even than my conditioner. I wanted to do the same routine with this mask as I do with the others so I skipped my normal after-shampoo conditioner and after washing my hair as usual I squeezed out the excess water and worked the mask into my hair, concentrating on the body of my hair first and using less toward the roots. I let it set about 20 min (the directions recommend 5-20 min) and thoroughly rinsed it out. While I was rinsing I noticed that my hair didn't feel nearly as soft as it does with Argan masks and was still tangled feeling. My hair actually feels softer rinsing out my regular conditioner than it did with this mask. I was pretty disappointed. I did notice a slight difference with the level of frizz the next day but shine and softness were nowhere near what I was looking for. I'll be sticking to Argan masks from here on out. I don't know if it is just something about my chemical makeup or if it's the product, I know some things work better for some people than others so maybe coconut oil just isn't the best product for me. I'll probably finish this mask off shaving to keep my skin moisturized instead of for my hair. I chose to rate this product with 3 stars because although it didn't work so well for my hair the all natural ingredients were gentle on my ultra sensitive skin (a LOT of products break me out in hives or a rash), smells really good, and left my legs soft  and moisturized without any shave bumps.

I did receive my coconut oil mask as a free promotional sample for testing and evaluation purposes. I was not paid for my review and was asked only to provide whatever feedback I may have about the product, whether it be positive or negative. I welcome both positive or negative feedback as well. My review is solely based on my experience and honest opinions of this mask.",1458518400,0,0,1,0,0

Loud, sounds like Barbie handling a concrete drill.
Constantly sprays. The spraying, doesn't stop unless you press the blue button. To me, that's backwards. It should turn on when I press the handle button, but the real on button is on the side. However, you get used to it quick after you sprayed water everywhere a few times :D.
Can't replace flossing (unfortunately you'd need a sandblaster to replace string flossing, and that would be painful.)
Your mouth will fill with water quickly, so you have to spit multiple times (really not a big deal but took time to get used to.)

Pros:
Your mouth feels dentist clean!
It's fun in a gadgety way.
Easy to setup. The coil on the handle NEVER tangles.
Has many head options for different cleaning needs.

However, after using this soap, I may have to rethink that habit. This soap really does seem to leave skin feeling both clean (with no film left after rinsing) and quite soft. The claims on the back about containing 1/4 moisturizing cream appear to be quite true. Compared to the sometimes tight, post shower feel that I get with my usual choice of soap (generally the plain Kirkland brand at Costco), this is clearly a superior bar of soap.

The only drawback to this soap is the scent, which is the usual strong smell for men's hair and body products. If it were a little less intense, it'd be okay, but it is so strong that the paper box the soap comes in reeks of it. If you're okay with the strong smell and you want something which leaves you very clean but still with soft skin, this is a pretty good choice which is several cuts above the cheap stuff.",1365120000,0,0,0,1,0

A formula that didn't dry quickly, stained my clothing, and turned me orange is what I was fearing. However, this spray has me pleasantly surprised. The spray is lightweight and dries quickly upon application. I have fair skin and the fair to medium glow gave me just a little color (which I appreciated) and did help to even out my skin tone (it helped to diminish the darker areas from previous exposure to the sun and also age spots). The spray also has an extremely light scent; you can barely tell it is there, even directly after applying the product. This is good for my sensitive skin, and also, for those who use them, will not clash with cologne and other scented body products. And, it did not rub off onto my clothing, either.

I seem to be in the minority as far as my rating for this product, but I have to base my review on my own personal experience. Some other reviews have mentioned using a less expensive product, such as Jergens. I cannot use almost all of the Jergens skincare products, as they cause severe dermatitis, which ends up in a trip to the doctor's office (I am not talking mild irritation, here). I do not think the price for this product is exorbitant, either.  If you plan on using this product daily, then I suppose it could get expensive. For myself, I will use this spray occasionally, when I want my entire body (and not just my face) to benefit from a little glow and a little color, especially during the warmer weather. I also believe you get what you pay for. As I already stated, this tinted body spray does not aggravate my allergy prone skin, and I am sure that is probably due to better ingredients in a higher quality product. I think this spray is good value for the money, and would definitely purchase it for myself or another member of my family (and, yes, the skin sensitivity is hereditary and runs in my family).",1432252800,0,0,0,0,1

And was happy to see that they are rated the SOFT type of bristles. Well I began brushing with these toothbrushes and was somewhat taken back the first time that I brushed as these are NOT SOFT bristles, they are MEDIUM bristles. However, I am finding that two weeks later, and even brushing over 2 minutes, my very fussy gums DO NOT BLEED. And I find that my teeth and gums feel very clean. Very happy about this as I have very fussy gums (sensitive) and they have responded well to my using this toothbrush. Below I will share how I use this toothbrush on my very finicky gums...

How I brush with this toothbrush: I brush (twice a day or more) for 2 to 3 minutes, however, I do not press down too hard with this toothbrush, press down too hard on the gums can cause irritation I found. What I find is the most helpful is brushing at moderate pressure for 2 to 3 minutes. Then I use a antiseptic rinse and my teeth, mouth and gums are good to go for hours.
Also I brush at night before bedtime (and sometimes after lunch), so this toothbrush gets a great workout. Even brushing as often (and long) as I do, I have no problems with this toothbrush  and it is great quality and I believe it will last longer than the cheap generic types of toothbrushes do.

I really never connected the thing is that I have pigmented lips, and because they pull red, any color always has a reddish cast to it. And definitely no pink lipstick, especially anything lighter than medium, ever looked right.

I started looking around to see if there was some product I could use, since foundation is just drying and causes flaking. I was told that MAC makes a good lip coverup, but it's $20 (why is everything at MAC $20 and up?) I don't have a problem spending the money, but since there's no freestanding MAC store near me, I thought I'd give this Etude House concealer a try.

And it's good. Unlike plain foundation, it's very glossy when you first apply it. It truly blots out your real lip color; it's like lip White-Out. In a mirror, you look like you're looking at a photo negative!

This stuff is way too glossy to put anything over it without blotting. The dry down takes forever without blotting, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that once I blotted, the white out effect was still very much there, just not glossy, and so, ready for lipstick. The one thing it does really well  is block out the red of my lips and give my lip products a much truer color payoff.

I was very pleasantly surprised at how well it turned out. The only caution I'd say is you don't need to put on as much of this as I did; you'll just be wasting product, and there's no dry down when you overdo it!",1456963200,0,0,0,1,0

I have bought over 20 different designs of Tattify after having problems with Jamberry metallic wraps splitting apart and the company not honoring their return policy on defective merchandise.  These are more delicate to put on so I would recommend using tweezers.  They can also be difficult to get off the plastic sheet. However they stick on the nail very well and last for a long time. When I apply them, I first paint my nail with a base color very close to the base color of the wrap. I do this because I do not personally care for the nail showing, but it is not necessary. After the base color is well dried, I put the wrap on as directed.  I next put a few coats of clear over the next few days on top of the nails to protect them.  The last set I had on lasted for two weeks without any problems and they only came off when I removed them. I wash dishes by hand, wash my hair, clean the house, type, go to work, and have no issues with these decals coming off.

This product combined with the Body Toinique Hydration tonic spray has been my holy grail of skin care. It has drawn up my saggy skin like some miracle sent by God & I do not have a double chin or turkey neck as I have lost over 290 pounds. I don't have a single wrinkle on my face at age 40 and my pores are not even visable and my complextion is even and smooth. I have used the Body Tonique product's in combination for 3 years styarting with the classic spray and moving to the rest of the line. This is my single most favorite item. It takes only a pea size amount ater your classic drys and the smell is amazing and has no competition as the classic spray has no scent so it's neutral. This is so light and refreshing not greasy or heavy. I also use it after I shave any part of my body and to treat my hair very curly frizzy hair so it stays tamed which is important when your a fashion and skin care model.  I love that  when I read the ingredients alone it's all organic and natural not to mention all those products seperate would cost me well over the cost of this product and I know because I have tried on my own to make my own skin care and have never been able to but somehow this combination far exceeds the quality I have even paid an embaressing amount of well over $60 for from big department stores with no results, break outs, cloged pores and even skin rash or burns from the excess of essential oils added. Regardless of the season this is my moisturizer after I use my Body Tonique Classic. I am Italian with fair skin and HAD dry, itchy, red sensitive skin with acne. But the best part is if you produce not enough oil or your skin is too oily this  balance's it perfect. My husband is African american and 67 and his is oily. It works wonders for both of us we share the same skin care. Including the amazing lemongrass scented shampoo, conditioner and  body wash that wakes me up in the morning or gives me a calm spa like aroma at night. I have to mention I also no longer have any dark circles under my eyes or on my eye lids and I did before I hated it, I looked like I had a sun burn ring around my eyes but after using the eye cream within just a few weeks it literally faded all together. At this point seeing for me is believing so Im a Body Tonique girl to the MAX now. But what is even more amazing is I mentioned I'm a skin care model and I was not before I started using this skin care line, in fact if you would have told me I would be one I would have lughed at you. But it's true I am now a skin care model for many companies but I never even use their products I use Body Tonique to keep my skin and hair healthy and amazing. Just so you see the results I included my photos of the day before I started using the Classic spray and I posted it on my facebook page for all to see and my now photo and you will see I wear zero makeup and take natural no photo shop or touch up modeling photos.

Why would I want to wash my hands with sea salt?  Happily, this PRE DE PROVENCE SEA SALT FRENCH SOAP BAR (150g, 5.2 Ounce) is no different from the other Pre de Provence soaps--it smells wonderful, and produces a rich, thick lather.

This product is used for just 5 minutes a day to maintain the whiteness of (previously) bleached teeth. (All the other Crest Whitestrip products advise a 30-minute treatment, once or twice a day protocol).  There are virtually no side-effects, such as sensitive teeth, or ""burned"" gums, as the contact time is just 5 minutes. This system has a 6% hydrogen peroxide gel, the same as Crest Classic Whitestrips. A tartar inhibitor is included for those who form tartar easily.

An alternative to this product of daily bleaching maintenance is to use one of the original systems again, such as Classic Whitestrips for 1-2 weeks to restore the bleach white color of the teeth.

Crest White Strips come in as many as 7 different formulations, which can be quite confusing to the consumer. Please remember the key difference in all these products is the strength of the hydrogen peroxide gel, and of course the price. The higher the dose of hydrogen peroxide, the faster the bleaching result, and the most costly as well. Here is a quick summary of the products:

1. Crest White Strips Classic. This is Crest's first bleaching product, introduced in 2001. It has a 6% hydrogen peroxide gel, and is applied twice a day for 30 minutes for 14-days of treatment. It is still a very popular product, and perhaps offers the lowest number of side-effects.

2. Crest White Strips Premium came out in 2004. It is a 10% hydrogen peroxide gel, applied twice a day for 30 minutes each session, for 7-days of treatment. The 10% hydrogen peroxide strength offers a quicker bleaching result, but perhaps with more tooth and gum sensitivity.

3. Crest Pro Effects came out in 2008. It is another 10% hydrogen peroxide gel, but offers a 10-day treatment protocol - again, twice a day for 30 minutes each time.

4. Crest Advanced Seal is the latest product (February, 2009), and it also has a 10% hydrogen peroxide, twice a day, 30-minutes a day, 10-day treatment. The main advantage to this system is that the strip is more adherent to the teeth, and the user can talk, exercise, drive, be active, even drink fluids, with the strip in place. The other systems advise the user to be stationary for the 30-minute treatment time.

5. Daily Whitening Multicare is another 6% hydrogen peroxide gel strip. It is used just 5-minutes/day.  The only difference between this product and the featured product is the lack of a tartar inhibitor.

In using any of the Crest bleaching products, please follow the specified instructions that come with each product.

Crest White Strip products work for the vast majority of people. Younger people with yellow stains seem to respond better than older people or those with gray stains. If you have severely stained teeth, especially those with tetracycline (an antibiotic) stain, the strips may not work well for you.

If you are not satisfied with the results and still want whiter teeth, you can then see your dentist for a more concentrated in-office form of bleaching (called ""power bleaching"").

I gave this product a 3-star rating, as I don't think the consumer needs a tartar-inhibitor in the bleaching agent. Normal everyday brushing and flossing should keep tartar away.

Lice Shield is a specialty shampoo and conditioner in one pack that claims to be worth its money, but in long term, it actually doesn't do the job at bringing out the best in protection after a few uses. It might be good only in small cases, but if you have had long and difficult cases at getting rid of those pesky problems, it can be better if stronger. It does leave a noble scent, but honestly more could have been brought n to make it more long lasting. I would recommend it for only minor lice cases, but honestly you are just better off going somewhere else for extra protection.

I was even inspired to try applying false eyelashes with these tweezers.  I don't have a lot of practice with applying falsies, so I was all thumbs.  It was really helpful to use these tweezers to hold and apply the lashes. The tweezers have a really nice grip and are thin, but not sharp, so I wasn't worried about poking my eye.  They allowed me to manipulate the lashes, put the glue on, and try attempt after attempt after attempt to get them to stick to my eyelid.

I really love the ingrown hair tweezers - they are really sharp, so they don't rip up my skin when getting out those deep ingrowns.  I've used them to get millia out, too.  The regular tweezers are a little bulky for fine detail work, but they are sturdy and have a good grip for those pesky strong hairs.

I haven't been diagnosed with eczema, but I know I have tried another similar lotion in the past and it helped more than regular lotions or creams. Also, my sister has eczema so there is a good chance it's what I have as well and I let her try this cream as well! I love that this product is organic with all natural with ingredients like aloe vera, vitamin c, vitamin a, manuka honey, shea butter, coconut oil, cehami.  Also I am really intrigued how they pH their products to 5.5 to enable the body to heal and maintain healthy skin. After using their other products, I noticed that my hair and skin have improved so I hoped this eczema cream would do the same. I like to go as natural as possible especially with products on my skin. Eczema is said to be an immune system response to toxic chemicals built up in the body. So this natural product makes a lot of sense!

I first tried this cream and it was thick, a nice texture, unscented and went on smoothly. I tried it all over because personally I like a thicker cream for my skin. I made sure to pay extra attention to my hands and elbows to really see how well it worked. It absorbed pretty quickly, but not fully, which I like because I feel like it needs to keep working on my skin. When it absorbs totally I tend to add more. It helped with the itchy spots on my hands and soothed my skin in general. I started to use this every day and not only have those specific spots started to go away and be less itchy, but also I noticed it seemed to also calm spots on my legs with ingrown hairs or irritation in my pores. For me, this is a really good product, but I wanted to have my sister try since she has worse issues.

After explaining to her all of the great ingredients and a little about how the pH 5.5 works, she tried this product on her eczema spots and said it was a big difference right away with the itchiness! I gave her the bottle to try and she reported that this product helped more than a cream prescribed by her doctor and that cream wasn't nearly as big of a jar and definitely not natural! This cream is helping to heal a spot that never goes away on her and no other creams have worked to help. Overall, this cream worked for my sister and I. I am so glad I was able to buy this product at a discount in return for my honest and unbiased opinion.

Product description
Scent Name: Violate  |  Size:150 Gram
For centuries, the luxury of French-milled soaps has remained the gold standard of excellence. Each time you begin to lather a French made soap, you enter a time and place where quality and craftsmanship have stood still. Traditional French soap is triple-milled to produce a completely uniform and smooth soap, without impurities, thus lasting longer. Every bar of Pre de Provence soap is not only carefully made today by the dedicated soapmakers in Provence following their proud traditions, but quad-milled to be smoother and have a richer lather to create our luxurious feel. Using all pure, natural ingredients enriched with shea butter, you can feel the difference of our unique quad-milling process. Aromatic fragrances transport you to a moment of calmness, vitality, dreamin or well-being. This 150 Gram bar is a great value, the fragrance maintains until the soap is all used up. The soap creates a rich, creamy lather and rinses clean, leaving skin soft and hydrated.",1504656000,0,0,0,0,1

While the scent for this mist is decent and works nicely with the Bum Bum Cream, I'm not sure where you're getting this beach smell, and more importantly, the scent fails to last. The cream on its own is what carries the scent -- with or without the fragrance mist, the cream's scent is strong. The mist adds a nice whiff initially but that's about it.

Frankly, there are way too many nice body mists to try out for me to buy this again, but if you're religious about Bum Bum Cream, then I suggest you stay with this because the fragrance in the cream is such that it won't really meld with many other perfumes.

I've been shaving my head for the last fifteen years and my face for considerably longer. I switched to a safety razor for facial shaving more years ago than I care to remember and I have yet to find a disposable or replaceable or for that matter rechargeable (and I have tried quite a few) that comes anywhere close to equaling the resultant closeness of cut or smoothness particularly when those infuriating independent gray hairs that crop up under the chin are considered. However, I am not as adept in avoiding a sling blade result on the back of my head with a safety razor so I am constantly in the market to identify a disposable or replaceable that fills the bill.

To that end, the ProGlide is acceptable but I still had to make several passes on the back of my head to get a smooth, minimally stubby result, not unlike the outcomes with a Mach 3 or Schick 3... or one of the five rechargeables currently residing in one bathroom or another. Interesting enough, I also got better results on my head with the back side trimmer single blade than the front side five blade shredder.  I didn't feel any discomfort like pulling or tugging or experience any inadvertent nicks. Actually, I was mildly surprised that it had cut as close as it did since it felt like it was not cutting at all which I suppose is somewhat of an endorsement.

However, with the ongoing cost of replacement cartridges, for my needs there are far too many less expensive, equally beneficial alternatives.",1327795200,0,0,1,0,0

Whiter teeth? Moi? I brushed my teeth twice every day and had them regularly cleaned twice a year. Yet, close inspection indicated they were indeed a bit yellow and stained, and I always assumed it was just my age. Or maybe it was the coffee or red wine. So, if a new girlfriend suggests Whitestrips, then Whitestrips it is. Several days later we went to a pharmacy and purchased the ""Crest Whitestrips Premium"" packet.

I followed the instructions as closely as possible. It was a bit difficult getting started with getting the strips on and then holding them in place for the suggested time. I finally worked out a routine wherein I would fit them in prior to driving to her place. When I'd get there, I'd discard them. When I'd head back for home (about a 20-minute trip), I'd put a new pair in and take them out upon arrival. I'd make the round trip about every couple days so it took a little longer for the total whitening treatment but the arrangement worked fine and didn't waste any time. Plus it was easy to remember.

We began noticing the whitening after about three or four days. It was very subtle and gradual at first, but by the end of the packet, my teeth were noticeably whiter and brighter. It was a good improvement. The whitening agent was applied, of course, only to the front teeth, but those are the most noticeable and it works out fairly well for my smile. I'd say if you want whiter, brighter teeth this is a reasonably good product and not very expensive. It's not perfect, and I may try a few of the other whitening methods. It's also not permanent and I've now got a third kit for another go at whitening. Using the procedure about every year to 1.5 years seems to work best for me.

It goes on white, for easy application, and dries clear. It is sticky, but a little cuticle oil or cornstarch helps, if it's a bother. I didn't find it so sticky it was unmanageable, I just exercised a little care.

This latex works exactly as I need it to for stamping. It peels off cleanly, in a single piece. It doesn't peel up my stamping, and it makes cleanup minimal. I'm very happy with my purchase, and would recommend it.

Many years have past and I have shot through quite a few Waterpik models and this is the current one I own. It is a little more evolved than its predecessors, but it still performs in pretty much the same way it always has. You fill the reservoir with water, attach the head to the handle which has a control to turn the water stream on and off, and then turn the device on to produce a spray of water as you move the head around to remove debris from between your teeth and gums. I think of the Waterpik as a power washer for the teeth and gums because it forces out pressurized water to irrigate those areas.
This model has a varying speed control to increase the water pressure to whatever is comfortable and effective for the individual user. It also comes with six different tips. While I use the flossing tip, there are tips for brace wearers, people who have crowns,etc, a tongue cleaner, and a couple of other tips for specific functions.
Other than eliminating the need to floss, the Waterpik has been beneficial to me. My teeth are always clean, I don't have gum disease, plaque, dental decay, etc.

I knew I would be able to tell right away if it was working because my teeth are sensitive every day. After using the first strip, there was no relief and I was disappointed but I read in the instructions that it could use another strip the next day if you still have sensitivity. Well, I didn't want to wait until the next day and about an hour later, I went ahead and used a second strip. Now, this time I did notice a tiny bit of relief. I was surprised by that but still wished it were stronger. I think the product works but you probably will have to use more than one strip for each tooth. I don't like the fact that these are so short either. I expected them to be the length of the Crest White Strips or other strips like that. These are more like a small patch that covers about 2 teeth or maybe 3 small teeth at the most. I think these strips could definitely be stronger since 2 gave me a tiny bit of relief but with 1, I never noticed any difference. I plan to use a third strip to see if I can make the sensitivity go completely away. I do like the fact that these are supposed to last 30 days. It hasn't been a month yet so I don't know if that is true. I still think these can be good for people who don't have as sensitive teeth as mine. Just wish they made each strip stronger or longer so they covered more teeth. These can be quite expensive for just 6 little strips (patches) so I feel like I should get more for my money. Especially if I have to use 2 or 3 strips just for one tooth. Starts to not feel worth the money.

6948,5,"08 14, 2017",A2CZ98V784SRJ0,B01E7UKR38,"I **LOVE** my Essies.  They are by far my favorite nail polish brand (and one of only two brands I will buy--only others are impossible on my nails).  Even though I have less-than-stellar technique and I am admittedly horribly hard on my nails, with Essie I can keep my nails looking professionally manicured without chips, redos, or drama. I am loyal to this brand for a reason!

WEAR TIME:  I'm fairly new to the Gel Couture line, though I've worn the classic Essie polishes for much longer.  I wondered how these would compare to my regular Essie routing (which is, Grow Stronger base coat, 2 coats of color, followed by Good to Go top coat), and I was astounded to find they compare very, very favorably.  I swear by Essie base coat, but was impressed that Gel Couture performed equally well with and without it.  (I do still like using it for a treatment layer and to prevent nail discoloration overtime; with Gel Couture I noticed no difference in wear time with or without base coat, though base coat  is a game changer with the classic Essies).  With my classic Essie colors, I tend to get about a week of wear, but do reapply top coat intermittently during the week (my goal is always every other day, but I usually forget pretty often).  In testing these out, I resisted reapplying top coat AT ALL, so that I could get a sense of how they wore on one application.  I'm quite impressed.  I got 11 days of wear, with a small few chips coming of the 11th or 12th day (depending on the shade).  I'm more than satisfied with that, given that I'm ridiculously hard on my nails and don't own a dishwasher.  Also, aside from Essie, I've found (at any price point) that there's only one other brand that doesn't chip within 24 hours (I can usually get 4 or 5 days with Revlon, so it's my second choice).  I went from a week with ""regular"" Essie to almost TWO weeks with these.  These last well past the point where I want to change my polish colors.

COLOR APPLICATION:  I've tried 7 of these Gala Bolds (as well as some from the original release and all but two of the Ballet Nudes), and I would say that with the exception of ONE shade, all of these polishes are dreamy to work with.  These are slightly thicker, more jelly like consistency than the classic Essies.  They are smooth and self leveling, apply like butter and look as smooth as satin.  The drip-free brush has a fabulous contour, so even working on my small nails, the wider brush was not an issue.  Most shades were opaque in one coat (but I'm a two coat girl, so I went for two anyway).  As Essie herself says, they ""Go on like silk and wear like Iron.""  The one color with a less stellar experience was ""Wearing Hue"" and if you sort Amazon reviews by color (yup, that's possible) you'll notice that most of the few negative reviews relate to that shade.  It's not an impossible shade, and milky opaque pastel colors are the more ""struggle-some"" colors in any range.  However, I did need a third coat to get to opaque and needed be more careful about not overflowing the nail bed. It still self leveled and wore beautifully.  I'd give this one shade 4 stars, but the others deserve more than 5.

(And anytime you are working with Essie, be patient with your perceived mistakes; give them a moment, they will self level and look as smooth as a calm sea even if you thought your application wasn't perfect.  They may be magic.)

TOP COAT:  I've taken to using this top coat with regular Essies instead of my Good to Go top coat.  There's magic in this bottle. Instead of getting 6-7 days with classic Essies, I can get more (though, I rarely want to, as I like to change my nail colors.)  With this top coat on Gel Couture, I am seeing 11 days!  Also, though I reapplied the Good to Go throughout the week, I don't feel the need to reapply with this one.  The Good to Go MIGHT stay a little (tiny bit) shinier through the week, but that's a hard call.  Though both wear well, this is my favorite.  Both dry super fast.  Like, ridiculously fast.  (I am currently testing the Gel Setter one, so I can't compare it yet.)  You do need to use this top coat with the Gel Couture polishes (or they won't last), however it's nice that it will work with traditional Essies as well.

I called Essie about this Platinum Gel Couture Top Coat, since I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be an improvement on the Gel Couture Top Coat (which is what it was called in the initial release of this line).  Essie has FABULOUS customer service, and they were able to confirm that it was a rebranding, and Gel Couture Top Coat and Platinum Gel Couture Top Coat are the same thing, just slightly rebranded.  (Not to be confused with the Gel Setter top coat, which IS different, and is NOT the one to use with this line.)

I can never recommend Essie enough.  They changed my nail game.  When I was almost ready to give up because fixing my nails took soooo long to do and to dry and I was getting so frustrated with fixing my mistakes, I discovered Essie.  They are MAGIC, I tell you.  They dry to a pro finish in spite of weak skills, and before I have a chance to screw them up.  And they stay on my impossible nails.  There's nothing remotely as good.

However, when I dropped the bomb in the tub I was pleasantly surprised with how subtle the scent was. My entire house smelled great! Whether you're just starting to buy Essential Me products or you've been using them for a while. This is one of my favorite bath bomb. It left my skin smelling faintly like fresh flowers and left super soft. These Love and Hearts Bath Bombs are a delightful bath time treat that are great for use either alone or with a partner. Once ""detonated"", it will turn your water a lovely shade of pink and scatter several paper heart petals throughout the tub. I found that these petals were relatively easy to clean up after, in fact, most ended up dissolved by the time I left the bath. It's scent is strong and floral, and tends to linger on your skin and in the room for a little while after you're done. I would definitely recommend this classic bath bomb to just about anyone.
I cannot wait to try some other bombs and purchase this one again as well. These bombs definitely takes baths to the next level!

First, the temperature readout is in celsius rather than fahrenheit, which is a bit of an issue for Americans (though perhaps we ought to be able to use the measurement system the rest of the world uses). More importantly, the temp control and power buttons are exactly where a right-handed person's thumb ends up while using the brush. With practice, this might be less of a problem, but we found that we were always turning it off and on and changing the temperature, completely by accident, while using the brush.

Possibly because of the temp buttons issue, it took longer to get sleek straight hair with this brush than with a flatiron. You can't just brush your hair and have straight and shiny locks unless it's straight to begin with. You're less likely to burn yourself, though, and the results were very nice. My daughter's heavy, course, wavy hair was smooth, soft, and super shiny.

6973,5,"04 13, 2010",AOTMP0OKJOUWI,B01EGH00J8,"The movie came out. I work in an elementary school and am surrounded by kids constantly, so naturally I have to go see the cool (and quality) movies that excite the kids (and this one looked pretty good.) So I went to the theatre and thoroughly enjoyed the enchanting story and incredible imagination. So no disrepect to those aspects of the movie whatsoever.

BUT I firmly believe this movie would have not been what it was without the score. I can't remember the time I had heard a score that so well matched the story and emotion of a film. This movie is loosely based on a children's book and I think the music somehow brought along that literary magic. Just listen to the music and you can tell more or less what part of the movie it is. I remember sitting in the theatre, stunned at how well this music supported the story.

Thus, I am calling this storybook music. It's sweet, simple, and all the while completely joyous/powerful/sad/whatever the occassion called for. A little Celtic touch completes the magic, not to mention those certain chords tying all the pieces together. I left the theatre believing the music was the best part of an already awesome movie and downloaded the album.

And here is an example of this music's power: My classroom, last week, was painted and recarpeted. This of course meant that moving back in was hell and at this time I still don't know where a quarter of my things are--including the CD player used for listening centers, story readings, and the five minutes after recess where I play instrumental music to calm down the kids. So instead I pulled out my music-playing phone and turned up the volume on this album. Every student who had seen the movie IMMEDIATELY recognized what the music was (and became very excited and defeated the purpose of the calming down period).

If squirrly first graders are touched enough by this music to recognize it, well, I can't tell you a more powerful testimony.",1271116800,0,0,0,0,1

The bristles are unbelievably soft and give a really even powder coverage and its very easy to vary the fullness of coverage with this brush. The angle is absolutely perfect for applying foundation.

Fits great in her hand and is very comfortable to hold. She has used it on her wet hair and dry and it glides through much easier than a regular brush and gets the tangles on its way. No tugging or pulling on her hair and damaging it by having to ""yank"" it out because the snarls are too much. The bristles are flexible but sturdy at the same time where they get through the hair good. They do not have any rubber or anything on the ends of them so it can feel a little rough on the scalp but nothing that hurts or is painful. Definitely working well for her and would recommend to others who have tangling and knot issues with their hair.
I even tried it because the underside of my hair gets knotted from rubbing on collars of my shirts or my jackets and it was easy to use and my knots were easy to remove with it. Definitely happy with this.

Being able to use it in or out of the shower is a real plus, though it seems to work better dry.

Update:
With the amount of hair I have, I guess it's no surprise that this thing won't last a life time.  I dropped my first BG one too many times in the shower and it finally gave out.
Of course this product is so great at what it does, that it was a no brainer to replace it.
The only complaint I have about the BodyGroom is how delicate the foil guard is.  It is very easy to get bent or dented, and when that happens, you can get some unexpected snagging from the cutting blades.  The best way to prevent any damage to the foil (which incidentally, is not covered by the warranty), is to be very careful when removing and disassembling the unit to clean it.

Now in terms of performance--this thing can plow through a lot of hair, but works better if you keep up with your trimming regularly.  If you are doing a particular hairy part, like your legs, clip them dry and be sure to tap out the hair that gets caught up in the shaver head regularly.

The guards are basically useless and will frustrate you if you are trying to do any type of styling (say, shaved down to the skin on your torso, but leaving a little longer happy trail).  More times than not, I just ditch the guards and take it all o

It is so dry that you have to layer it on and it does bleed and smudge,it also fades when i drink water.

8555,5,"02 27, 2016",AVO8UB9IDYW1I,B016OGYVVM,"This nail art aid is very handy and easy to use. I'm a self-proclaimed nailista, and paint my nails or apply some type of nail art almost daily. I found the description of this product a little confusing, because it describes more than one product. It mentions both Liquid Palisade, which is a liquid latex, and glue, which can be used the same way, but behaves differently. Indeed, this product, itself, acts like sort of a hybrid of the two.

The first thing I noticed was how good it smells. It has a sweet, candy-like fragrance. The next thing I noticed was how thick it is. It was easy to apply to my cuticles, and its thickness made it easy to see during application. It went on pink, and as it dried, it turned clear. The dry time is quite long; like glue, it took 6-8 minutes to fully dry. Once dry, if my fingers accidentally touched, they didn't stick together and peel off the product, like latex does.

I applied a thick layer when I used it for the first time, thinking it would be like glue, which is hard to peel off if it's not thick enough. Again, it's more like latex, in this aspect, because it peels off easily, even when a thin layer is applied. Like with normal glue, thin works best in relation to drying time. I love that it doesn't give me the sweaty, sometimes uncomfortable feeling I get when using latex; this product seems to be more porous, like glue. It peels off quickly and easily, all in one piece, like latex. So, again, this barrier has properties of both latex and glue. I believe it's latex with additives that make it less sticky, but I'm not positive, so, if you have a latex allergy, you should do some research. As for me, I quite like it, and besides the drying time, it seems to take on all the best attributes of both products.

I received a discount on this nail art barrier in exchange for my evaluation and unbiased review. Any opinion I've expressed is purely my own and based on my personal experience using this product.",1456531200,0,0,0,0,1

We use different products in our home but they are always the big names (Crest, Colgate, Rembrandt etc.).  I guess it really depends on if I have a coupon and if it is on sale.

This mouthwash flavor of spearmint surge is what made us try it originally because that is what my husband and I prefer.  As far as mouthwash goes it is just so much better in cutting down the burning sensation compared to the Listerine brand.  I hate that feeling!  There was a bit of burning but not as intense.  The flavor was spearmint but it felt it to be a tad too sweet for my taste.  My husband enjoyed it and didn't complain of sweetness.  I found that using this mouthwash at any time did not react to my drinking or eating.  I also found that my breath felt fresher throughout the day; as did my husband which can suffer from a bit of halitosis at times.  If you have a chronic condition or feel that your breath isn't the best then you will feel a difference, but this is not a miracle cure for rotting teeth or debilitating chronic halitosis caused by a pre-existing condition.

When I worked at various dental offices when I was younger, we always gave out samples of Colgate products.  Even though I try to shop on a budget, I do find that I still gravitate to their products to this day.

Highly recommend if you are the type that needs the reassurance that mouthwash can provide.  Doesn't burn as much and is sweeter.  Personally that is a turn-off but my husband has requested that I pick up another bottle since the original finished.  He still swears that his breath was fresher and his teeth felt 'cleaner'.

Loud, sounds like Barbie handling a concrete drill.
Constantly sprays. The spraying, doesn't stop unless you press the blue button. To me, that's backwards. It should turn on when I press the handle button, but the real on button is on the side. However, you get used to it quick after you sprayed water everywhere a few times :D.
Can't replace flossing (unfortunately you'd need a sandblaster to replace string flossing, and that would be painful.)
Your mouth will fill with water quickly, so you have to spit multiple times (really not a big deal but took time to get used to.)

Your mouth feels dentist clean!
It's fun in a gadgety way.

When I saw this exfoliator that firmly holds the soap in place (with Velcro no less), I decided to give it a try.

The holder is a good size and even fits a thick bar of soap. The Velcro closure works very well to firmly keep the soap inside the sleeve. The soft washing side provides a nice bubbly lather. The exfoliating side, however, if pretty rough, even using a soft touch. I really can't use it as it hurts to the point of leaving scratches on my skin. But the most concerning part about this soap envelope, however, is that it doesn't dry between showers, and that doesn't seem sanitary.

The Panasonic ES8109S 3-blade - barely. Put the Remington blades and cutter (keeping the center blade of the Panasonic) on a Panasonic 13,000 RPM shaver and you would have the World's best electric shaver. The Remington shaved a little closer than the Panasonic and provided a faster shave. However, the difficulty in cleaning, noise and lack of a charging base tipped me to the Panasonic as the final choice.

This is a review of three Panasonic models; ES8243A (4-blade), ES8109S (3-blade) and ES7109, the Remington MS2-390, the Norelco 8260 CC and the Braun Series 5 8995 (8985 & 8975 only differ in displays and cleaning). I have an average beard and have been using electric shavers (foils and rotaries) over 30 years. The models here are no better than any of the other higher quality shavers I've owned. It takes about 10 minutes (no shaver will give you a first-pass close shave) to get to that good dry shave (with or without pre-electric gels/oils) and you do have to put pressure on to get a close shave. This means recharging every 4-5 days. Gels/oils do make the process easier - not faster - and I have reviewed six of them on their Amazon sites.

ES8109S: This 3-blade shaver gives a very close shave, with some work. It does give off a higher pitch `whine', while shaving, that is somewhat annoying, but is not what I would consider noisy. Nor is the cleaning operation noisy. Based upon other reviewers, I was expecting it to sound like a lawn mower, but it is just an occasional buzzing noise as it cleans. The ""Arc Foil"" design slows shaving (see discussion, below).

ES8243A: I had hoped that the four blades of the Panasonic ES8243A just might be able to give a superior shave. As it turns out, the large four-blade surface is like trying to keep the end of a 2x4 on your face. It makes cutting in the areas where you don't have a lot of skin area (chin, jaw line, upper lip, base of sideburns, etc) more difficult. In fact, I think that the fourth blade in the middle actually interferes with a better shave and these two middle blades are not as good as the primary cutters. The ""Arc Foil"" design makes it even slower (see discussion, below). Another future problem with the 4-blade system is that you'll want to buy a new shaver when your blades and foil need to be replaced. What kind of an idiot is going to spend 80% of the cost of a new shaver just to get a set of new cutter blades and foil? All in all: the ES8243A 4-blade is a poor value.

ES7109S: The flat design of the foil is a better design than the ""Arc Foil"" (see below). Unfortunately, this shaver has an under-powered motor and the floating head that cannot be locked.

Panasonic discussion: Panasonic had developed an outstanding shaver line some ten years ago. My old ES8067 still shaves closer than this new ""NANO Technology""- a misnomer (marketing gimmick). I think the reason is that Panasonic's older models came with cutting blades with the individual blades having been about half the width of all of Panasonic's newer cutting blades (including replacements). This means more surface area on the newer blades and that means less cutting. Remington has the ideal blades (that Panasonic used to make) and it shows in closer cutting and less time spent doing so. Additionally, these new Panasonic ""Arc Foil"" shavers have the foil curving AWAY from your face at the ends of the foil, further decreasing exposure to the blades and requiring many more passes to cover the same area. Unfortunately, Panasonic puts their better motor (13,000 RPMs) only on these ill-conceived ""Arc Foil"" designs. Battery time on the Panasonics is the shortest of all shavers reviewed here. The Panasonic trimmers are so narrow, on all of these models, that you will not be able to trim sideburns with one attempt. You will have to re-position the trimmer to get what you missed. This increases the probability that you will get an uneven sideburn.

The Remington MS2-390 has the blades that the Panasonics should have (and did have years ago): flat foil area (not ""Arc Foiled""), good length (25% longer) and ultra thin cutting blades. As a result, closeness of the shave is better and time spent is shorter. This is, however, the loudest (and it is loud) of all shavers and there are no bells and whistles. Using a pre-shave oil/gel will gum up the blades, as with any shaver, but these blades pop off with even the slightest brushing so be prepared to watch them fall into the sink with every cleaning attempt. A charging stand would greatly increase the convenience of this shaver. Remington did a poor job with the details.

The Braun Series 5 8995 tries hard (you can hear noticeable slowing when necessary pressure is applied, like a lawn mower when it reaches thicker grass), but it doesn't get quite as close as the Panasonics or Remington without leaving a stronger burning sensation after the shave. The Braun can also leave burn marks and even cuts (nose and lips) that will bleed. Odd: you would think that, with it getting so close as to actually burn the skin, it would also give a closer shave. I suppose this is proof that shavers cannot ""lift"" hairs to cut better. Additionally, the design of the handle is inferior, making positioning more difficult. It does have a much wider trimmer and longer battery life between charges, though.

The Norelco 8260 CC: I used this rotary-type of shaver for many years during the 80's. I switched to foil and found I could get a closer shave. This is still the case. Additionally, because of the circular blades, it is somewhat difficult to target certain spots for cleanup. However, this is the quietest shaver.

PS: don't accept the nonsense about giving your face 30 days to adjust, unless you are coming off a blade. If you are accustomed to an electric shaver, you only need a week or two to determine the difference. The only thing magical about 30 days is that you can no longer return it for a refund - what a coincidence!",1260748800,0,0,1,0,0

After the time was up for it to come off I was surprised because there were definitely visible results that happened and my pout looked much fuller but the problem was it also looked like around my mouth had swollen up a little as well.  There was definitely noticeable results so next time I am going to make it go only around my lips, possibly cut it?  Also, I would suggest using these for going out or a special occasion because the results aren't permanent but only last for a little while.

I've been using a standard corded Wahl trimmer off and on for a number of years to keep certain areas of body hair in check without hassle. When I saw this Philips-Norelco body hair trimmer as the deal of the day here at Amazon I jumped at the opportunity. For one thing thinking that this trimmer was specifically designed for more coarse body hair I figured it would make grooming easier. Secondly the unit is cordless which is always easier.

So a few days after my trimmer arrived I stepped into the shower planning on making a quick trim before heading out with some friends. The first thing I notice is that this trimmer feels cheap. Everything from the trimmer to the attachment heads is made from cheap plastic. The trimmer doesn't feel like it has the weight to cut through hair and once I started trimming my suspicions were spot-on accurate. The BG2020 is more of a hair-puller than trimmer.

I ended up having to repeatedly pass the BG2020 over certain areas which inevitably leads to irritation. I thought maybe it works better with shower turned on and wet. Wrong again.

So I ended up chucking this thing in a bathroom drawer and I honestly don't plan on ever using it again. What a waste of $30. If you have anything more than peach fuzz I would recommend staying away!",1247011200,1,0,0,0,0

used to be in curl reviving tonic. I am surprised and disappointed that they put it in.  It is known to be toxic. I wrote the company and told
them my feelings about this. If many people would complain, they would probably take it out.
See the following for a commentary.

Phenoxyethanol is a glycol ether. Glycols are a series of chemicals that find their way into all sorts of things: paint, lacquer, jet fuel..... Phenoxyethanol is used as an anti-bacterial in cosmetics as well as a stabilizer in perfume.

The product's Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) says that it phenoxyethanol is harmful if swallowed, inhaled or absorbed through the skin and that it can cause reproductive damage. The MSDS refers to 100% concentrations, so is it safe at lower doses? In cosmetics the concentrations are typically 0.5% to 1%.

There are several animal studies that demonstrate that it is toxic - with effects on the brain and the nervous system - at moderate concentrations. In Japan, there is a concentration limit for its use in cosmetics. In Europe, the European Union classifies it as an irritant and there are various studies (on rabbit skin, for example) that demonstrate reactions at low doses. The EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) data sheets show chromosomal changes and genetic mutation effects in testing as well as testicular atrophy and interference with reproductivity in mice.

I also came across a report written by a medical professional who contracted allergies after coming into contact with phenoxyethanol in a detergent used for cleaning lab equipment.  It seems he wasn't a fluke. There are over 3,000 known allergans and they were studied, along with the data from 9,948 patients, by a research team in Germany. Phenoxyethanol was in the top 10. An Italian study also determined that phenoxyethanol is a contact allergan. However, a 1990 article in the Journal of the American College of Toxicology said that it was only a mild irritant to rabbit skin at 2%.

Concern that phenoxyethanol is a neurotoxin precedes the FDA. German research in 1999, concluded that it had neurotoxin potential.

Phenoxyethanol breaks down to phenol and acetaldehyde, acetaldehyde converts to acetate. Phenol can disable the immune system's primary response mechanism. Given that, it is at best ironic, that phenoxyethanol is used as an anti-bacterial in vaccines. Acetaldehyde occurs during the breakdown of ethanol, (alchohol and 2-phenoxyETHANOL), it is a suspected carcinogen. Inhalation studies have shown irritation of the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract.",1433030400,1,0,0,0,0

The unit is small and doesn't take up a lot of room, which is a plus as you begin to accumulate numerous rechargeable products.

The sanitizing is done by UV light, so there are no cleaning solutions to buy; once you've bought the Sanitizer, you're done.  There's a light that flashes while it's working and it stays lit when the (approximately) 10 minute cycle is complete.

The one caveat is that you need to make sure this fits your brand/model of toothbrush, as you won't be able to use it otherwise.

When I used a manual toothbrush, I would typically throw one away after having been ill and begin using a new one.  I realize there may be no scientific or biological advantage to doing this, but it always made sense to me.  It's a little expensive to do that with cost of ultrasonic toothbrush replacement heads, so this is a nice alternative.

While there is no tangible proof the UV light has actually sanitized the toothbrush head, we'll have to take it on faith that it has - and it's been made quick, easy and relatively inexpensive, so why not?

I bought the pink back in Feb. 2015, still using it just got tired of the color, and this one seems slightly less opaque but maybe it's because that one is pink on pale skin but a second coat fixes the opacity, (only 1 coat in the pic). It may leave a few specks of the shimmer on your skin when you peel it off but they wipe away effortlessly.

If you're new to nail art and want to use this for that, I do suggest you transfer some to an empty polish bottle (cleaned with acetone or brand new doesn't matter) using a syringe with some sort of tip, an eye dropper or even a straw, this will keep the large bottle from drying out.

That might sound scary but its so wonderfully fine that it looks radiant and as if it was coming from within. For everyday makeup I reach for this no matter what Im wearing or what makeup goes on, it just looks alive even before I have my coffee without looking over done.

 This shade is sultry and sun kissed with this Hollywood Photoshop filler thing going on, it simply looks delicious. I love the whole range and Im also a fan of the NARS Sin  and Orgasm blushes, but this is the best.

It's a much better built machine and it feels like it. It's also about half as quiet.  Beware however, it's a bit narrower and can slip out of your hand much easier.  The foil on this one is really tight and doesn't constantly fall out.

The tool holder works great and is really neat. You'd never know all that stuff was back there built into the base.  The battery life is the same as the old one; meaning, GREAT!  I tried the other head on someone else and it works fine. I can't use it on me, because I was constantly screwing around with the old one, so I said the heck with it and completely shaved all my body hair off.  Now, I've come to prefer it that way and so does my wife.

Many people say this doesn't shave completely smooth, I have very fine hair which is the toughest on it and while there is a little stubble, it's barely noticable. In fact, it's probably better then any foil shaver out there period!

Truthfully, I also bought a traditional skinny lip liner at the same time and forgot to use this when I first had it. When I was running out of the house, I threw it in my bag..I then forgot about it again...for about a week..ooops...

Well..........one day I was at work and my liner had worn off (my job consists of talking on the phone for hours.). My gloss was too light and would have looked not so good without liner. So I was digging to see if I had anything else with me to add some color..Then I found this!!! It's so funny..this has actually turned out to be my favorite lipstick. Yup. That's what I did. I applied it on my entire lip and when I looked at how pretty it was, I decided this might need to be the only thing I need in my lipstick collection.

It goes on sooooooo easily, like velvet. It can be used as a liner or for the entire lip. I will tell you, this color is gorgeous and everyone should have it. It lasted fairly long..as long as can be expected when you run your mouth for a living anyway.
It is a roll up design so there's no need for an annoying sharpener. This really is an all around awesome product.

I just need to say..this color and product and how perfectly it goes on are a really big plus. The only thing I can probably compare it with is the old school actresses in the 40's who had the matte lip. Perfectly shaped and rich in color.

I will definitely be buying a bunch of these, because now I'm in love with it and am scared they won't make it anymore..(I have issues. :))

6512,5,"05 22, 2016",A3I1AUNT38MLJ2,B018YBS5SK,"Amber light therapy is also sometimes referred to as yellow or orange light therapy. It encompasses the range of wavelengths from 570 nm to 620 nm.

How Does It Work & What Is It Good For:
Amber light has quite a shallow skin penetration but is effective in the treatment of skin issues involving redness, such as spider veins. Though it is not typically used for tissue healing or collagen/elastin production, where it excels is in the treatment of problems such as sun damage. It is often considered to be an ideal therapy for sensitive skin, as its therapy is calming and soothing. Amber light therapy is frequently recommended as a drug free alternative treatment for skin redness and flushing, irritation, rosacea, UV radiation damage, and reducing the appearance of the tiny blood vessels on the nose and face. It helps to flush waste from the skin, boost lymphatic flow, and increase cellular growth. Orange light returns a vitality to skin that has lost its sheen. Especially recommended for wedding days and portraits, orange light works on dull complexions to bring out a brilliant healthy glow.

How Often Should I Use It:
4 to 6 times a week for the first 2 to 3 weeks, then at least 3 times a week for at least 3 months. The more and longer you use it the better results you will get.

Benefits of amber light:
Improvements you can see  amber light therapy reduces redness, evens out the complexion and calms irritated skin. When used regularly, this means visible, ongoing benefits for many rosacea sufferers.
Benefits that start working fast  no rosacea treatment is immediate, but many users of amber light therapy for rosacea find that this treatment works faster and more consistently than most other products they have ever tried.
Quick and easy treatments  treating the entire face can be as fast as 4.5 minutes per day.
Side effect-free  when LED amber light therapy is used according to the product directions, there are no known side effects linked to its regular use.
Portable  both the bulb and the clamp light (sold separately) are light, small and durable so that you won't have to skip out on treatments just because you won't be at home. Toss them in a tote, suitcase or even a decent-sized handbag. The bulb when used according to the directions, should last a lifetime!

7038,5,"07 10, 2017",A2HC6393M5LUEI,B01GSGC3PY,"This is a fantastic set of bottles! I've never used a bottle with a totally adjustable nozzle before. You can spray a strong, accurate stream, or spray a wide, soft shower of water droplets.
It depends how far you turn the nozzle left or right. It's pretty brilliant, and more bottles should have this feature. It seems obvious.

People are usually pretty picky about the type of spray they want- in reviews for spray bottles, there are often complaints about the spray not shooting out a mist of any sort, that it only sprays a stream of water. For the same bottles, people insist that they love the light mist it produces. Either way, it's usually hard to find the perfect middle road to suit everyone and their.. perceptions you could say.
In this case, everybody wins!

These plastic spray bottles are really cute. Their shape is petite and attractive, and they fit comfortably in my hand. You can actually paint and decorate the outside surface if you're a creative person. The surface is nice and smooth, and even spray paint would work well.
If you're a DIYer, these spray bottles are just as good to store witch hazel toners & rose hydrolats as they are for feeding plants and refreshing your room air, body, and linen with essential oils & distilled water.

I wouldn't mind owning another size up also, if it were available. Either way, these bottles are convenient and you can travel with them if need be. They lock so you don't ever have to worry about the liquid leaking out.
So far, absolutely no problems. I've had so many issues with the more expensive glass spray bottles, and this inexpensive set of bottles works much more efficiently, to my relief.
The price at the time of my purchase was cheaper than mostly any other 6-pack of decent looking spray bottles on Amazon. Regardless, these are probably the best spray bottles I've ever purchased. They're lightweight, reliable, sturdy, useful, and the perfect size, with an adjustable spray nozzle, lock, and a comfortable grip.
I've wasted too much money on dark glass spray and lotion bottles that simply don't work. I'm pretty happy with my purchase and I believe you will be too. ",1499644800,0,0,0,0,1

The 10-pack is useful to me because I'm breakout prone, and can't afford to take the risk of wearing the same headband again.  This gives me enough headbands so that I use a fresh headband every day and still make it to ""laundry day.""

These headbands are better than the other HBY headbands I tried that were made out of shiny spandex.  (Which were slippery, poorly stitched, and definitely not moisture-wicking at all.)  These appear to be some type of cotton blend jersey, which is very comfortable and grips my smooth hair better, and there are no problems with the seams.  The product description says 5 inches, but they're really more like 4.75 inches, but that works in my favor, since the wider ones slide off my head too easily.

Also, unlike the other headbands I tried, this time I got exactly the colors that were pictured in the product photos.  These headbands are much better performers overall than the spandex ones, and I'm happy with the quality.  I still can't use these for running or sleeping, since they slide off my smooth hair at the drop of a hat, but they are very useful for face-washing and general lounging.  I've attached a photo showing the smooth jersey knit, for reference.

I have to say first that I am not an experienced user of either cosmetics or products claiming to clear your skin. That said, I have found that rose oil water is effective at shortening the life of some of my acne. I think THIS product is actually either eliminating some blackheads, or at least making my pores smaller. And it smells and feels really good when you use it. Very pleasant texture somewhere between a mud mask and extremely fine exfoliant. It doesn't dry out my skin and I live in an extremely dry high desert climate, but it isn't oily, either.

You have to put it on after you wash your face, and then wait a few minutes, which does add time to my morning routine of washing my face and then just heading out the door. But I believe it is worth it

Be realistic in your expectation of any face products, none of them can give you skin like Nicole Kidman. I'm still breaking out with my annoying 'spots' but this product does seem to make my pores less conspicuous, which for me is quite an achievement.

The serum is contained in a frosted glass pump which helps protect active ingredients. The serum itself is a thin textured and lightweight. When applied to clean skin, you feel an instant cooling sensation (there's no peppermint or menthol listed, so I'm not sure what is causing it) and a mild tightening effect. This is nothing like those instant ""face lift solutions"" that just pull your skin taut. It's mild, but I think detectable. The serum feels like it absorbs instantly. There is a very soft, subtle, vaguely powdery floral scent to it which dissipates quickly.

I'm not sure what kind of long term effects this might have but I will say my skin just looks better and feels better and other skincare products and makeup apply very easily on top. This serum does contain glycerin and a silicone derivative which probably help with how the product feels on the skin. Active ingredients are interesting and ones that I've not seen much before in skincare including; Scutellaria baicalensis root extract which stimulates the skin and increases elasticity and Sorghum juice  which has a micro-lifting effect on the skin. It also contains liposomes which relaxes and inhibits the uncontrolled contractions of facial muscles. As with most skincare that promises a lot, I'm not sure that this will do what it says long-term but short-term I'm very happy with the results of the product and how it makes my skin look.",1474070400,0,0,0,0,1

It's solid bamboo and does not flex like my smaller plastic one does.  The abrasive is the same on both sides and really grinds the dead skin off.  I wear flip flops a lot during the summer and something about them makes my heels get really dry and rough so a tool like this is very, very useful.

The shades applies well with the given applicators as well as with my pre-owned makeup brushes. The shades blended well and are super pigmented. I did not have to apply a lot of product for them to show on my eyelids. They are also very soft and smooth in terms of the powder so it doesn't take a lot of blending and later cleaning the powder off of your cheeks. The shades have a glittery shimmery tone to them so they can be used for bridal looks as well in addition to party looks. There is a big mirror on the lid so you can take it on the go and use it in your car or wherever. Personally I did not notice any smell coming from these.

This is OK nail polish, but I bought it because the description said it was good for stamping, so I thought it would give me really better results than the regular (mostly Wet and Wild) polishes I have been using so far. The black does seem more opaque and with it I got swatches I am quite happy with. The gold is brighter yellow, and perhaps a little more opaque than my current polish. The silver also seemed to work well. But after swatching on paper, I'm pretty sure the red and blue would only show up on a really light base color. The white showed up somewhat on top of darker colors, but didn't particularly stand out. I was able to get nice crisp images with all of the colors, so points for that. For what it's worth, the polish isn't particularly thick.and dries fairly quickly.  All in all, I'm fairly happy with the black, gold and silver, less so with the white, and least of all with the red and blue. I expect I will come up with uses for them, they just aren't quite what I was hoping for.

The regular slant tweezers do such a great job with plucking.  They have such a precision tip that they don't break off the hairs.  They grip securely every time and avoid the breakage that causes ingrown hairs.  I've also used the needle tip ones to remove ingrown hairs left by other tweezers and I love that they are super sharp and pointed - quickly grasping the hair under the skin and removing it without tearing up my skin.  They would also work very well to remove splinters without having to dig.  The curved tweezers are also very nice but I haven't needed to use them yet.  I imagine they would be good for placing small items for gluing, or for reaching into very small openings to retrieve something.

The whole set is made of high quality stainless steel, which makes them easy to disinfect with alcohol or soap and water.  The handles are brushed to give a more secure grip and the size of them (about 4 inches) is perfect for the average hand. Being stainless steel, they won't ever rust and the edges will stay sharp and aligned for many years.  I received the silver colored set, although the product page says they come in 4 colors.

I actually threw away my Tweezerman tweezers after I started using the Beneleaf tweezers. I didn't realize how much extra work the Tweezerman ones cost me in repeatedly plucking the same hair, broken hairs and later ingrown hairs. Plus my Tweezerman tweezers were $20, and this set of 3 Beneleaf precision tweezers is $23!  If you are also fighting a cheap or worn out set of tweezers, I highly recommend this Beneleaf set.

I received a complimentary set of Beneleaf professional tweezers for testing and review purposes. I wasn't asked to leave a positive review, nor was I paid or otherwise compensated for reviewing this product.

Nail polish never lasts more than 24 hours on my fingernail no matter what I do. I was excited to try the 2 step polish that requires no cure.

I did two test runs:

Did no nail prep. Just followed directions, two coats of color, one coat of top.

Dries quickly, leaves great gloss

Day 1: Looks great
Day 2: very small chipping to start on dominate hand.
Day 3: chipping on 85% of nails

I remove all polish and prep my nails this time just as I would with doing real gel nails. (Push back cuitical, buf nail to remove shine, cleans, add dehydrator, two coats color, one coat of top.

Day 1-2: Looks great
Day 3: chipping starting on dominate hand
Day 4: removed

Because I can get a much longer wear than my regular polish I say this is a win. A girl (or guy) that tylically gets a fairly long wear with regular polish may get a 5-7 day wear but 14 days may be a streach!

However, I noticed that if I failed to rinse my white sink thoroughly after spitting it out, in the morning there were brown stains. I could get them off the porcelain fairly easily but that combined with the staining reports of other reviewers is enough evidence to look elsewhere for an alcohol-free mouthwash. In my opinion, it is downright stupid of a manufacturer to market a product that they know stains teeth, saying as they do here, ""In some cases, antimicrobial rinses may cause surface staining to teeth. This is not permanent or harmful, and may be prevented by adequate brushing or removed at your next dental visit.""

People who care about their appearance do not want filthy-looking teeth, even temporarily. Some may attempt to scrape off the offending film (which is probably oxidized plaque that inevitably forms on some surfaces even with good brushing) and in so doing, damage the enamel of their teeth.

All that cold weather and dry heat and going in and out of doors takes it toll on your skin.  Particularly the skin on your face.  Dry weather makes your face dryand with more visible wrinkles, fine lines, and aged.

Try something new this fallderma e Natural Skincare.  Family owned and operated for over 30 years, derma e has pioneered the development of vitamin-rich, high-performance antioxidant skincare solutions.  Their award-winning line features doctor-developed, consumer-tested, and clinically-tested face care, body care, and treatment products that are free of parabens, phthalates, mineral oil and petrolatum.  They are also cruelty-free, gluten-free and 100 percent vegan.

Youd think with products like this that derma e would be one of those expensive department store brands, but youd be wrong.  You can fight aging from the comfort of your very own local Walgreens, Whole Foods Markets, ULTA Beauty, and CVS.  derma e can be found in over 16,500 retail stores in the USA.  They even care about the environment with their manufacturing and operations, which are offset 100% by wind power.

I will fight aging with derma e Anti-Wrinkle Vitamin A Retinyl Palmitate Crme, which helps to diminish the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, leaving skin soft, smooth, and supple.  Its made for all skin types, so it doesnt matter if you have dry, oily, or even combination skin like me.  This is a fairly fragrance-free cream moisturizer that leaves my skin feeling soft and young-looking.  I use it on my freshly-washed face both morning and evening.  It works well on my neck as well.

So while Im protecting my skin from a little extra time in the sun (since its not as hot as an over this time of year), you can fight aging skin from the dryness of colder air and from running the heater.  I recommend you check out all of the derma e products, which include&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Derma-E-Firming-Moisturizer-DMAE-Alpha-Lipoic-C-Ester-2-Ounce/dp/B000EX5JO0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Derma E Firming Moisturizer, DMAE, Alpha Lipoic, C-Ester, 2 Ounce</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/derma-e-Hyaluronic-Acid-Day-Crme-2-Ounces/dp/B0009ET6BQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">derma e Hyaluronic Acid Day Crme, 2-Ounces</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/derma-e-Hyaluronic-Acid-Night-Crme-2-Ounces/dp/B0009ET6CK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">derma e Hyaluronic Acid Night Crme, 2-Ounces</a>.

The natural and organic ingredients like Manuka Honey, nutrient-rich Kelp, Chamomile and Ginger helps cleanse the skin without stripping it and leave it feeling naturally clean and hydrated.

Well, I have finally found it!  This is now one of my ""must have"" products, along with several others that I never deviate from.

Gels leave my hair crunchy, and so do most mousses.  Not only that, but they make the curls clump together which makes my very fine hair look horribly thin and wet.  Then, if I try to fluff it or brush it out, my hair becomes frizzy and it loses the curl.

Alterna Texturing Glaze makes my hair soft, not crunchy, and it leaves it full.  It is so hard to explain, because I didn't believe it based on what the other reviews were saying.  But I got a gift certificate that I was able to use so I thought I would give it a try.  I have wavy, fine, thin hair, and this stuff just keeps the wave in it while taking away any frizz.  It almost looks like I have a nice perm that I don't have to use styling products to enhance it (if that makes sense).  When I touch my hair, it feels like I don't have any product in it.

I put this glaze on while my hair is wet, just before I blow dry it.  I use about 1/2 teaspoon and I work it through all of my hair.  After I am done blow drying it, I spray it with hairspray and I am good to go.

I am so glad I gave this stuff a try, because it is what I have been looking for for years.  I was constantly trying a different gel or mousse but they all did the same thing.  Now, I don't have to look any further!",1312675200,0,0,0,0,1

I went from dry to oily to combination skin. Ive gone to the dermatologist, who put me on a regimen that has now made my skin the driest its ever been. I don't appreciate my skin peeling every afternoon, and Im also tired of putting harsh chemicals on my skin. I recently made to switch to all-natural makeup, and Ive been looking for a brand to switch to all natural skin care. Hence, I was excited when I got to try out the Living Nature line at a discount.

The first thing that attracted me to this product is the fact that its made in New Zealand. I had the pleasure of visiting N Zed a couple years ago, and it was refreshing to see the high standards that the country has on organics the lack of pesticides, hormones and additives seen in meat, and how much fresher and better everything there smelled and tasted. Having been there, I automatically trust the products produced there more than I would anywhere else.

As far as this natural night cream goes, Ive been using it every night, in conjunction with the rest of the line of Living Nature products, and I am very happy with the results. I have been using products with hyaluronic acid for years, and sometimes you can tell a difference and sometimes you can't.  I can definitely tell the difference in my skin with this cream.  The cream goes on smoothly, and I can see/feel my skin getting firmer already. My skin is no longer peeling every afternoon, and not only is it a lot clearer/more even in tone, but its also a lot firmer and youthful looking. I can now see that the chemical products I was using were making my skin worse, not better.

I also have to mention that I really love the natural smell that the products in this line have. It reminds of hiking through Karangahake Gorge and all the plant life you could smell whilst walking next to the raging river: damp, tropical, fresh, exotic.

It looks like Ive found the brand to finally make the switch to all natural face products. Highly recommend!",1467676800,0,0,0,0,1

You work it into your skin for a couple of minutes, then leave it on for a few minutes before rinsing it off.  There are no unpronounceable ingredients in it, and it smells like peppermint.  It's a very thick bilious colored liquid dispensed through the bottle cap.  I've used it four times with great results on my skin and one unexpected but welcome side effect.

The MTC initially feels like mud, but there's a really refreshing tingle that's just great first thing in the morning.  If you're of the generation that used a product called Seabreeze, that's exactly the sensation, only stronger.  The tingle doesn't go away until the stuff is rinsed off, either, and skin feels really clean.  I have some large pores around my nose, and they're thoroughly flattened by
this stuff.

If you have dry skin, go easy with this, and use a good moisturizer afterwards.  I have an oily T Zone with dry cheeks, and have learned to concentrate on my oily areas with the MTC, with just a quick once over on the dryer areas of my face.  I've been using this just before showering in the morning, and then using the shower to rinse it off--and here's the unexpected side effect: my miserable early spring sinuses have improved!  I think it's the herbs in the product coupled with the steam from the shower, but my whole sinus area feels SO much more open.  Hooray!

I'm thrilled with this product.  My skin feels awake and energized, and the products I use daily--serums, moisturizer, and BB cream--just sink right in after use.

This is a BEAUTIFUL brush set with 12 different options for putting on makeup. I was surprised by how large the set was when it arrived in the mail. The brushes came nestled in a container and each brush was individually wrapped. The brushes are truly lovely.

Each brush is light pink with pink metal and ultra-soft bristles. The brushes apply makeup without any streaks or lines. The ends are so soft and high quality that it picks up my makeup perfectly and goes on smooth. There are several different brushes for mineral make up powder (which I use), contouring, eye makeup, eyebrow makeup and lips! I find that it applies my face powder which is mineral powder perfectly and quickly and the makeup doesn't fall off the brushes and get all over.

The container is high quality synthetic leather and light pink much like the rest of the set. It is great for travel or displaying your brushes. I set it on my counter and it keeps my brushes nice and safe. I love this set! 5/5 stars for value, quality and design!

If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer! I received a discounted promotional sample of this item for my honest and unbiased review.",1439942400,0,0,0,0,1
8623,5,"07 8, 2016",A3OU5DEQVEJC2S,B017WQUXKG,"Vitamin C is one of my favorite skincare products. It really is a wonderful all around ingredient; it helps with brightening skin, lightening age spots, stretch marks, and reducing fine lines and wrinkles.

I like the packaging of this product. It is easy to read the information on the label. I love that it comes in a pump dispenser bottle; very hygienic and easy to use! A small pump was enough serum to cover my whole face and some of my neck, which shows that this bottle will last me a long time. The serum itself has a somewhat unpleasant scent, but not anything that bothers me. The scent wasn't noticeable once I applied the product to my face. The serum went smoothly onto my face. As it was absorbing into my skin, my face felt sticky. As the product absorbed into my skin, I feel like it didn't fully absorb into my skin. It left a slight film on my face. The serum doe help to make my face brighter and look more awake in the morning! I have also been using this serum at night, after my toner and before my moisturizer. I have noticed that with regular use of this serum, my skin is brighter and my fine lines are diminishing, which is amazing!

Vitamin C serums can be used for more than just the face. Vitamin C is great for helping with stretch marks and aging hands as well. My mother has always used vitamin C on her hands, and they look very young for her age! I am excited to try this serum for those purposes too!

This serum also has other ingredients that are beneficial for the skin in terms of anti-aging, acne, and redness. Hyaluronic acid and vitamin E are amazing for the skin and anti aging. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",1467936000,0,0,0,0,1

It left skin feeling soft and smoothed. I would not recommend using a sugar scrub for your face. Sugar is too harsh on the face. Do not use sugar scrubs or plastic micro beads. Plastic beads are bad for the environment since they can't be filter and are sent in to our oceans. They also cause tearing in the skin of your face. Your face is too delicate. But sugar scrubs are fine for other parts of your body. I used this product on my arms and legs. I just used it on my hands to make my hands soft. Just be gentle when you're using this on your skin.

I'm very particular about primer, especially when it comes to how it feels on my face and the texture of it.  I was interested to try this, but it was going to take a lot to really impress me.

One thing that will turn me off from a primer immediately is the smell.  I don't like my primers to have a strong smell or anything like that, and right away I was pleased with the way this smells. I really liked the texture of this. I've found that most primers that work really well tend to have this texture, it's definitely thicker than a lotion and isn't runny at all.

Obviously the true test is how well does your makeup hold up??? Well, I worked a 10 hour shift and my face makeup still looked amazing, which is saying a lot during the summer! In fact, I kind of hope they make an eyelid primer, because as you can see in the picture my eye makeup did NOT hold up as well as my face makeup did!

My favorite primer happens to be a high end primer that generally tends to ""smash"" the competition, but I would say this primer is on par with that primer, and I love the addition of the vitamin E!

8362,5,"07 19, 2015",A331BHAR0TRLWT,B00XZCWPDK,"I received this product at a reduced price and was eager to try it and review it. I have always used the blue, thick Aloe Vera gel. It was goopy and sort of like Jello. Last year, I saw it in clear which was nicer than the fake blue stuff but still had a strange thick, jelly-like consistency. My husband sunburns constantly even with super high SPF on so we have Aloe Vera on hand all the time. It's also great for minor burns, cuts, scrapes and all sorts of things. This large bottle has 16 ounces of pure Aloe Vera in it. There are just a few inert preservatives and an ingredient to help the  gel coat the skin better.

The gel isn't really a gel but more like a serum. It is yellowish in color, very pale, and transparent. When I first poured some out (see photo), I couldn't imagine how it could do the job of soothing skin and actually absorbing into skin but but I was wrong. This gel is so much nicer to work with than the thick, jelly type. It immediately absorbs and isn't greasy at all. There's no tacky feeling or, really, any sign that the gel is on the skin at all. But you will feel it soothe. I went to a graduation party the other day and both my husband and I inadvertently got a bit of sunburn, him much more than I. We both used this gel to sooth and cool the areas and it worked so well. My husband, who was a devoted Aloe Vera blue jelly user, loves the consistency of this product and how it just applies and dries with absolutely no wait time and no stickiness or greasiness. It immediately soothes and makes skin feel better.

I even took my make up off with it last nigh! I used some on a cotton round and it did a great job and left my face feeling soothed and clean. There are a ton of uses for Aloe Vera and this brand is even more versatile than the thick, goopy stuff. I truly like it more than any brand I have tried and I really didn't expect to. I thought I would hate it, to be honest, but I am a convert. I am already planning to buy more since we use it year round and like to have it on hand. Give it a try. You will get rid of a lot of the extra chemicals and thickeners and get more Aloe Vera for your money. Plus the formula is perfect for applying and going with no wait time for drying or for the stickiness to pass. Very, very good stuff that is somewhat unconventional as far as consistency but once tried, I can't imagine many people wanting to switch back to the jelly stuff.",1437264000,0,0,0,0,1

This version is alcohol free and is geared toward people 50 and older but has the same active ingredient as the Pro Health Invigorating Clean Invigorating Mint  alcohol based mouth rinse. It does not have fluoride.

I wish Crest would better explain how this is different from the products geared toward people under fifty.  For instance people of any age can have plaque, bad breath and inflamed gums. I think most of the Crest mouth rinses work against these issues so what makes this special for people over 50.

I did find this sentence on the back label of the bottle. ""This rinse was selected for people over 50 because it is alcohol-free and provides a unique sensation.""  I am not sure what ""a unique sensation"" has to do with being over fifty.  If that is the only reason it seems like other Crest Pro Health alcohol free products would work the same.

I like the taste of this product. It does not have the bitter alcohol flavor that  many alcohol flavored mouth rinses have. I don't notice a unique sensation.

I'm no stranger to peels; I know what my skin can handle, and I left it on for fifteen minutes. If you're new to these at home peels, I'd recommend starting with five minutes to see how your skin reacts.  This peel is mild enough to use a couple of times a week, and it's everything the manufacturer says it is.

There's no fragrance, and the solution comes in a dark blue dropper top bottle.  You only need a dropper full for a thin coat on face and neck.  After applying, there's a little tingle.  It's not unpleasant; it just lets you know the product is working.  The results are immediate.

It's safe to plan to use this the same day you want to look your best for an important event; it doesn't leave your skin red or raw, just refreshed.  I'd recommend using a hyurolonic oil or heavy-duty moisturizer afterwards.  Good stuff!

The gold flecks are not glittery at all and they add just a touch of sheen.  I also have the Nars Multiple in Orgasm, which I use first, then I go over it with the Orgasm powder formula, which together, provide all day wear.  The Super Orgasm is a coral flecked with gold, more gold than the Orgasm but still subtle.  Coral is a universally flattering shade and is especially pretty with summer colors.  Even in the winter, it keeps me from looking sallow.  Although I'm light, but not fair, with hazel eyes and dark blond hair, Super Orgasm would be equally pretty on medium or olive skin or African American coloring.  The formula lasts all day without changing color or fading, so you won't need to touch it up.  I love Nars makeup, except the foundation, and I use the creme blush in Cactus Flower under the Super Orgasm powder blush to give it extra staying power.  My skin is oily but if you chose to use just the powder blush, it would be fine for normal or dry skin types.  I've had these Nars blushes for several years and have yet to put a dent in them. It takes only a swipe or two with a brush to get the proper amount of product.  Granted, I don't use either one every day but there's a considerable amount of product in each so they're very economical.  They are unique and totally worth the extra cash.

Accordingly I was really excited to try out Off Tropic from the Spring 2016 collection, particularly because I don't have a lot of greens in my polish collection. In person, I found this to be a bit darker than I was expecting, especially given it's intended as a summer polish.  It's hard to accurately pin down the color.  It's a very deep green that is almost evergreen to me, but with a bit more blue. To me it also has that 'classic' nail polish finish.  While I will admit this isn't a color I would have probably picked out on my own I've warmed up to it the more I've worn it and it's definitely very different from anything else in my collection.

Experience-wise, I liked applying this. I found it to be consistent with my previous experience applying Essie polish. I know some people find it to be on the thin side, but I personally find it makes this easier to apply. I like the thickness of this polish much better than Julep, which I find to be thicker and a little unruly at times. It's also deeply pigmented.  So much so that it seemed like I could have almost gotten away with a single coat, though I prefer two.  That said, it isn't 5-free (though it is DBP, Toluene and Formaldehyde free) so if that is important to you, you'll want to go with a different nail polish brand, but I've never had any adverse reactions to Essie.

I have very dry skin and make up crepes under my eyes as a result.  Yes, I've tried many other creams (specifically, every one olay has ever come out with); I've also tried setting it with different powders after watching youtube videos.  For me, powder was the worst choice.

Since most beauty products cater to oily or combination skin,  I imagine that those of us with truly dry skin are more of a minority and so it's reasonable that this won't work for a lot of people.

But if you're like me and you could probably cover your face in olive oil and think, ""damn, now my skin looks nice"", this might be for you.  It is truly the only thing I've used that doesn't make my concealer or foundation crepe.

One reviewer compared it to Vaseline, which it is definitely not.  However, I can see where she was coming from.  It's thick and oily and just what my skin needs.

In 1888, a Mr Drake ate a piece of pound cake he enjoyed. By 1890, he had opened a bakery in Brooklyn that sold pound cakes, and went on to develop other products. In 1023 the Devil Dogs were born. Sometime in 2010, Drakes and Hostess was sold and good-bye devil dogs. Then in 2012 a new company took over, and devil dogs were once again on the menu.

I purchased a box of Devil Dogs recently. The taste has changed, not to my taste, exactly. Am not sure what has changed but certainly cheaper ingredients and lots of chemicals. An old taste memory is gone.

Straight off of the bat it is clear that it is not a gift soap, nor is it meant to be displayed.  Other than the logo and some simple text there is nothing eye-worthy on the bar, and there is no pretty package for visitors to see on their trip to your bathroom.  This soap is wrapped in a single piece of plastic and seems as heavy as a brick of that size.

The bar is infused inside and out with exfoliating herbs -which I am not crazy about- because they are too scratchy for me, but if you are looking for that slightly scratchy-scrubby exfoliation feeling then this may be the soap for you! (I don't use it on my face because it is too scratchy, but it is great for washing hands and feels invigorating.)

It lathers well, and seems to last longer than the cheaper store bought soaps I usually use.  (It is also quad-milled which apparently removes more impurities, and it is Paraben free.)

The scent, (herbs de Provence), is balanced well and doesnt appear overpowering.  It kind of smells like, silly to say, an herb basket with a perfumed French soap sitting in the middle.  The perfume is light, and not cloying, but lingers.

One was Oral B Glide Mint Floss (54.6 yards) and that's what I bought. I'm burdened with large hands and a small mouth. It's a bad combination for flossing. At least a decade ago, perhaps a lot longer, a dentist showed me a trick. He said to pull out about eight inches of floss and then tie the two cut ends together to make a loop. Then he said I could control the loop by using only the tips of two fingers on each hand. I found, by experimenting, that you had  to tie the two ends tightly  enough that they wouldn't pull apart under stress. That's really worked well and I've been flossing that way  ever since. This new floss seems to work well. Another problem I have is that some of my teeth are very close together and it can be a problem to floss them. Well, this floss seems to work better  than most. I wouldn't regard it as the best floss I've used, but it does a reasonably good job and is easy for me to use.

While Essie states 'up to 14 days', one has to assess what effects those 14 days.

First off, this is an extremely pale opaque white with a hint of pink.

Application will require 3 even light coats of this shade, followed by its top coat.  Let dry thoroughly between.  Not quite the gel shine tho.

This color is pale, which could account for results.

This polish will hold up well for two or three days if nails are protected somewhat. It will show signs of wear and small chipping at nail tips. It can be touched up effectively.",1500681600,0,0,0,1,0

This clings to the skin and envelops the wearer as there's nothing dainty and ladylike about this pungent and almost savory fragrance.

This wash smells like the salty ocean water, sunscreen lotion, sun, sand and a slight layer of milky fruit. It's really radiant and silky on and has the most incredible fresh scent; it makes me feel as if I have entered a paradise island and Im watching the sunset settling in misty colored sweet clouds as waves crash at my feet as I have never used a product that smelled this unique.

5370,5,"06 20, 2015",AI8DDPX23JCV2,B00L88S190,"I am very skeptical when it comes to any product that says it reduces cellulite or gets rid of cellulite, because there is no instant fix for dimple thighs (except for maybe liposuction or laser treatments but my budget doesn't allow for that).  I have tried many lotions, creams, massagers and nothing has ever seems to make a difference that I can see and feel.  I say feel, in reference to how smooth my skin feels on the back of my thighs compared to the front of my thighs after using this powder mixed into a scrub I've been using on the back & sides of my thighs & butt.

Before I started using this seaweed powder in a scrub I did exfoliate my legs/thighs & butt regularly.  No joke, I used the green side of a Scotch-Brite kitchen sponge to exfoliate the skin on my legs.  This is how I know this is not just because I all of a sudden started paying more attention to my thighs and exfoliating them with a scrub (seaweed or not) that my skin feels like this.  I have other body scrubs I use regularly but since I have quit using those on my thighs and just started using the seaweed scrub on my thighs, my skin feel much more even and soft.

The recipe on the side of the jar says: 3 tbsp Seaweed Powder, 1/4 cup sea salt, 1/4 cup olive oil, drop of essential oil.
I sort of tweaked the recipe on the side of the jar and added a few extra things.. I used
4 tbsp Seaweed Powder
1/4 cup sea salt
1/4 cup sugar
1 tbsp olive oil
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar (optional)
1/2 cup coconut oil (fractionated (liquid) works best but you can melt solid coconut oil and it will work fine too) - I started with a 1/4 cup and added about a 1/4 cup more because I like my scrubs a little more liquidy
& last but not least, Peppermint essential oil - A LOT, like I think I used a tablespoon or more trying to cover up the smell of the apple cider vinegar (which I may leave out next time).

I also tried sort of like a face mask on my butt & thighs, equal parts seaweed powder and sodium bentonite clay (""Indian Healing Clay"") and water until smooth and put this on my face and then added peppermint oil and put the rest on my thighs for about 15-20 min.  I really think its the combination of the seaweed powder with the peppermint oil that has made my skin/thighs look and feel so much better.  After looking at the concoction I made I realized the amount of seaweed powder is less of an overall percentage of the final product than what the bottle recipe is.  So I'll definitely try what the bottle says next time.

I am so very pleased with this product.  I am very grateful I was given this product to review because I don't think I would have thought an ocean weed could do anything for my skin, my thighs, or cellulite because I've tried so many products claiming to help cellulite.  That being said, this seaweed powder is amazing, and I will definitely be purchasing more when it runs out because I like the results I see.

Every time I use these wraps every few days, I lose 2-4 inches in my waist. The results last around 36 hours, and are not permanent. I have loose skin from having a baby, and this product does a good job at making my skin tighten back into place as well as make me look slightly thinner. The gel does not irritate the skin. I do these wraps during the day because I want to drink tons of water and flush out the toxins that it's drawing out of my body through urinating. The wraps fit across my whole midsection and around my love handles, up to my ribs and down to my lady area. It can be cut to use in multiple areas.

In my photo, I am the one in the Bikini top. Instead of the skin being saggy, the skin is tightened to my body as close as possible. This is 12 hours after use.

The product came boxed with the ingredients listed. You're also getting a sealed refill cushion compact included in the box which is amazing for the price. The compact is made of a high quality white plastic. It's easy to open using a push button in the front. There's a good size mirror in the upper lid and a hinged plastic cover to prevent the cushion from drying out. You can hear a soft click when it's closed, so you know it's not going to open inadvertently. There's a Myconos branded applicator that rests on top of the cover.

The foundation I got (#2) works well with my NC20-25 skin. It's not a heavy foundation. I would consider it moderate coverage at best. It's very blendable and like most cushion compacts, feels very light on the skin. I included a picture which shows a heavy application on my cheek blended out towards the front of my face. Wear is very good. I haven't felt the need to reapply after using it in the morning. Like a lot of Korean cosmetics, the quality and cutting edge technology used is amazing.

NOTE: Info shared from my wrapping scarf review...
""I go back and forth with my hair between flat-ironing, wearing my hair natural, and twists/braids. Yes, I go to You Tube for all kinds of helpful hints. A young lady was demonstrating how she kept her flat-ironed hair straight for a few days without flat-ironing it every day by wrapping her hair with a wrapping scarf. Of course I've seen these around but never knew how to use it effectively until that demo!

Came to Amazon to find one. CBS Express had the best deal, EXCELLENT service and it got here in a few days. It is everything I hoped for and does well. The wrapping scarf is for my straight styles.

The Truth Serum is my favorite of the three products. My face seems smoother and feels smooth and fresh after using it. I use it morning and night after cleansing my face. Moisturizer Creme seems to slide on over this serum. The Transformation Cream is OK, but I have another I prefer. The Invigorating Night Gel is exactly that, you can feel your skin tingle after application. I have not noted any real difference using this gel, but it has a nice feel. It feels sticky at first,but then fades away to smooth.

This kind if mini kit is a perfect method to try new products, and to decide what may work for you. I will certainly purchase the Truth Serum again.

The top stays on pretty tightly and securely, and is not a screw, obviously. You must pull it off and press it on, and there is some obvious resistance. The top will NOT easily fall off in a bag, so don't be too concerned about that.

Especially in comparison to Healthcom's 3mm colorful, round, screw-top plastic containers- the hearts are ertainly able to be trusted.
The 3mm round containers are tiny, and there is only 1 little twist to make, which isn't even a full revolution around..and you must make sure it is tightly twisted closed, or else it will certainly open. Just so you guys know.

 All of these heart containers come loosely thrown in a rough plastic bag.  Please be aware that the cheap plastic material of the containers is very easily scratched. Many will arrive slightly scratched already... Not in any major way, but they won't all be perfect.
A label on top should hide the scratches fine... if you have or make a heart shaped label. Otherwise, I'd suggest a few sparkly glue-on, or self-adhesive gems, or some glitter glue dots to decorate.
If you paint on a clear, thin layer of gloss or varnish, toss some glitter or other flat decorations on top, and it will look really shiny and pretty. There are many types of glosses and other shiny finishes, but Liquitex has dependable quality and a decent price. It's worth it- those bottles last for years, and never dry out. For such a small area to cover on these containers, the gloss would really last. I recommend it.

So all in all, these plastic heart containers are really cute and small, but also a perfect size for lip balm, powder and other small beauty products. They can definitely be used as samples, but also be sold with your DIY recipes as well.

If you think these hearts are cute, go for it. They are even cuter in person. And I'm not a huge heart person either. But they have definite novelty power going for them. And with ample security, these containers will not be a loss for you.",1480204800,0,0,0,1,0

My hair is pretty easy to curl, but it takes a while, and as a mom of two boys, I hardly have time to spend curling.
This thing saves me so much time if I want to add texture and body to my hair. I set it on a medium setting and held it in place for about 10-15 seconds. Once I released it I moved to the ends and did the same. It was quick, easy, and just works.
One thing I noticed, and this may just be with my hair because of how it is, but if I tried to re crimp a section that was already wavy, it would just get frizzy and wouldn't look as good as if I got it on the first try. Easy enough to work around, just worth mentioning.
Another note, not a problem enough to be worth removing a star, but definitely worth mentioning as well, the power indicator light doesn't go solid once it has reached the set temperature. It is like a strobe light show, but just flashes until you turn it off.
That made it kind of difficult to know when to start, but I just turned it on before I started my makeup and it's definitely ready by the time I go to use it. (About two minutes later)

I did a little research before I tested the emu oil. Here is a little background of the Emu bird;
They are native to Australia and they can grow to a large size - 6 feet in height. They cannot fly or walk backwards.
I have to admit that I feel bad using the oil after knowing what an Emu farm is. Raised and killed for their oil/meat. However this will not affect my review and rating for the oil.

The emu oil is not just for the hair and skin as moisturizer but it can be used to treat many chronic skin ailments;

- Rashes
- pain (muscle pain, back pain, legs, etc)
- sore feet
- blisters
- bug bites
- acne (due to anti-inflammatory properties)

The oil seem to be semi-transparent in color. It is a little cloudy with bubble like tissues? Perhaps is particles of fat? See picture 2 and 3.
The scent is extremely faint and you can hardly notice any. Nothing unpleasant.
The oil is non greasy and non oily. Very gently oil actually, almost like argan oil.
I applied just a dab bit on my hand and rubbed in a circular motion. It felt cool and moisturizing. No irritation or discomfort and no side-effect.
After about 3 minutes of drying, my skin felt very soft.

I feel that it is a waste to use it in hair because emu oil is very precious and quite expensive. I will use this for skin only; muscle pain, rashes, sores, etc.",1432684800,0,0,0,0,1

One of the reasons I got it is because of its nice bright orange color.  I prefer to have my products in dispensers that match the rest of my bathroom accessories and I have two identical dispensers made of frosted glass for my hand wash and face wash.  My hand wash is clear so the colored face wash helps identify which is which on those mornings where you are still more asleep than awake... It also has a very pleasing scent. Its citrusy, like oranges and I love smelling it when I use it.

It says to use a nickel size amount, mix with warm water, lather and apply to face in circular motions.  I find that a nickel sized amount is a lot.  I use a face brush,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nutra-Sonic-1020-Professional-4-Speed-Face-and-Body-Cleansing-System-Lavender/dp/B002RZKFAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nutra Sonic 1020 Professional 4 Speed Face and Body Cleansing System, Lavender</a>, I use a small drop or two (maybe half of the nickel size), lather, apply to face then use the brush to finish cleansing.  I've also tried splashing my face with water, applying a drop or two directly to the brush, running it under water and brushing my face.  Both seem to work.

I only use the brush at night. I almost always shower in the mornings because it helps wake me up and feel refreshed so I don't use the cleanser in the mornings. Using it once a day and only needing to use such a small amount has meant that I am now going on a year of use and I still have a good amount left.  So, buying a cheaper, thinner, runnier cleanser might be about the same thing if you end up having to use more of it.

I found that the suction cups really do work, they merely require a moment of set up before one is actually leaning against it. Set it up when outside the tub and it stayed in place well enough for me when only 2 suction cups were made to stick to the tub. To be direct, it's too much effort to make more than 2 suction cups stick.

The pillow dries quickly. On the back side is only plastic and the front side has the microfiber but it's real thin. It would feel awful if one had the plastic against one's skin, that's why the microfiber is used.

It's not a high-end item in my opinion. The reason I feel it gets 5-stars is that it does fit on the tub while one is leaning back on it. It's the shape, that's why it works and others probably don't.",1504310400,0,0,0,0,1

They are also supposed to provide the longevity of a gel manicure, without the need for a curing light or the difficult removal process.  The color I received, Beau-Tie, is a pretty deep purple creme.  It looks quite blue-leaning in the bottle, but is actually much warmer on the nail.  In any case, the color was pretty, and the polish did look nice on my nails.  The instructions say to use the polish on bare nails (no base coat), do two coats, and follow with a coat of topper.  I did this, and I did have a nice, shiny manicure.  The shine was obvious, but I'm not convinced that it's anything exclusive to Essie.  There are other topcoats that will give you a similar appearance.  This polish definitely did not last the two weeks that the package claimed it would.  I found it lasted for about as long as any other polish when worn with a good topcoat- about four days.  The bigger issue, for me, is that without a base coat, my nails were in rough shape when this polish started chipping and I removed it.  They've been weak, peeling, and splitting.  The result is that I won't be wearing this without base coat again.  The bigger takeaway is that I don't find this to be fundamentally different from other nail polishes.  The ""gel couture"" business seems like a gimmick.  Also, I'm accustomed to using a quick dry topcoat, and this one takes much longer.  Be advised!",1502755200,0,0,1,0,0

The latest one and sadly my last....for now....is this Manuka Honey & Manuka Oil Night Cream.
I've been testing out a few heavy night oils over the last couple weeks so I decided to just use this Night Cream on my decollete so I could get a good feel for what I liked about it without it being overrun by other products.
As I expected this is another gem of a product!  While the consistency is a bit thicker than the Day Cream, as it should be, it still absorbs nicely and leaves skin feeling really well hydrated and nourished.  I've been applying this at night right before bed and in the mornings I notice how soft, smooth and maybe even a little more plump my skin looks and feels.
This product contains the Manuka Honey & Manuka Oil which help fight the micro-organisms that cause irritation, help stimulate cell renewal while hydrating and leave skin looking and feeling revitalized.
So, once again, I am a big fan of all things Natural Beauty Limited.  They have some truly exceptional products that are definitely worth checking out!",1456876800,0,0,0,0,1

This is the first east Shea butter that I tried that is actually as creamy and soft as described and it has no gritty texture to it and it actually absorbs well. I only need a small amount for it spread over my skin so I'm trying to use it sparingly, since it is expensive, but it looks smaller than four ounces. I actually had to search for it in the box since it doesn't take up much space. I do hope that bigger sizes will be available. Although, I love the creamy texture of this product, but after a week, it stopped absorbing well on my skin and it seems to be causing my skin to get more dry. I was using this product to heal my blemishes and moisturize my dry feet, but in the end, it left my skin more dry and it didn't seem to toning my skin as I hoped, due to all the rave reviews about shea butter healing the skin. The product is just too oily and it just didn't seem to absorb well on my ends ogives skin to heal my blemishes. It does feel good on the skin on a hot day, but it's only on a hot day, when I can get the butter to not leave my skin so greasy and oily. If you have thick curly hair, please don't use Shea butter in your hair, I tried using some in my hair and I'm still trying to get the product out of my hair, it seems that Shea butters acts similar to glycerin or honey, since it seals moisture in, but at the same time, it can dry out your hair by stopping any new moisture from coming in your hair or your skin, I noticed when I used Shea butter in my hair, when my hair dried, it was very soft, but when I wet my hair, it seemed to get drier and drier and more weak since the Shea butter was preventing moisture from absorbing my hair. This is the reason why I can't recommend this product for hair but if you have different type of skin, it might be a good product to use on more dry and less sensitive. It's definitely not a bad product, and is a higher quality than any Shea butter than I found in natural food stores or on Amazon but it just doesn't work for me.",1472947200,0,0,1,0,0

602,4,"08 23, 2005",ABLOQZIL42W7I,B0001WXTPA,"I am a dentist who recommends Crest-brand White Strips to my patients becasue they do work to whiten teeth. However, they have to be used correctly and I recommend that you follow the directions exactly as specified inside the box.

1. First brush your teeth with a wet toothbrush to remove the layer of plaque (toothpaste is unnecessary). Rinse your teeth well with water.  Tooth enamel has pores, and the pores need to be open for the chemical to penetrate.

2. Use the strips as directed on the box.  The instructions will tell you to bleach twice a day for 30-minutes a time.  The inner part of the strip has a chemical called hydrogen peroxide; (in-office, or dentist-assisted dental whitening uses a 15-35% version of the same chemical) that causes the stains inside your teeth to be oxidized and turn white. Applying the strips has a small learning curve as you will probably bend or fold a couple of them before you get the technique down.

2. Leave the strips on for the time recommended in the instructions and do not overbleach your teeth, as this leads to sensitivity.

Disadvantages

1. Hydrogen Peroxide can ""burn"" your gums. If you notice a burning sensation when you use the product, it is the chemical oxidizing (or burning) your gums (it will turn them white with a minor chemical burn). Depending on how severe the burning is, it may cause you to want to stop the treatment. It is OK to stop the treatment for a day or two to let the gums heal. Once they are healed, resume treatment with the White Strips. Try to not get the strip on your gums.

2. Your teeth may become senstiive during the week treatment time. Try to tolerate the sensitivity if it is mild, but if more severe, take a day or two off to let the teeth settle down and then pick up where you left off. You may notice much more sensitivity to cold water, ice cream, etc.  The peroxide causes an inflamation of the inner pulp, or nerve center of the tooth and makes the teeth very sensitive to biting or cold drinks or foods.  If your teeth become too sensitive, back off on the strips until the sensitivity is gone before resuming bleaching.

3. The strips only cover your front teeth, so only your front teeth will bleach. You may notice the distinct difference between the back (unbleached) teeth and the front (bleached) teeth. Since most people notice the front 6 teeth anyway, this is not a big deal. However, if you have a wide toothy smile, you may want to have a dentist make you a tray that will hold the chemical on the back teeth to whiten them too.

4. The bleaching effect works best on yellow stains. If your stains are due to tetracycline (brownish grey stains in a band on your teeth, your best bet is to have a dentist whiten your teeth as the dentist will use a tray to hold a more concentrated form of the chemical on your teeth for a longer period of time.

Now comes the confusing part: Crest White Strips come in 4 different packages, each a bit different than the others.  The main difference is in the strength of the hydrogen peroxide, and the price.  The higher the dose of hydrogen peroxide, the most costly the product package.  Here are the 4 packages:  1. Crest White Strips Classic (6% hydrogen peroxide, 14-day treatment).  2. Crest White Strips Premium (10% hydrogen peroxide, 7-day treatment).  3. Crest White Strips Premium Plus (10% hydrogen peroxide, and has 12 additional strips).  4. Crest White Strips Renewal (9.5% hydrogen peroxide).  The cheapest method (at around 25 dollars, is the Crest Classic Whitestrips, but it takes 2 weeks to complete the treatment).  Premium and Premium Pro are both 10% peroxide formulations, work in 7-10 days, and the ""Premuim-Plus"" gives you 12 additional strips.  I am not sure why Crest recently came out with ""Renewal"", as it is a 9.5% hydrogen peroxide formulation which is not significantly different from the 10% concentration. Leave it to the manufacturer to confuse the consumer!

Crest White Strips work for the vast majority of people. Younger people with yellow stains seem to respond better than older people or those with gray stains.  White Strips don't work as fast as a dentist-made custom tray bleaching, (or in-office bleaching) but over time, you will get a result that will be close to that of a dentist, and you will save money too.

I recommend starting with with either the Classic or the Premium-Pro. The Classic works in 2 weeks and is about $1.80 a day.  The Premium Pro works in 10 days and is about $2 dollars a day.  The Premium and Premium Pro are likely to give you more sensitivity than the Classic.  If you are not satisfied with the results and still want whiter teeth, you can then see your dentist for a more concentrated form of bleaching using a custom-tray system or in-office bleaching.  This is much more expensive, but eh concentration of hydrogen peroide is much higher and this works better on stubbornly-stained teeth.

I then massaged a pump of this cleanser for several minutes. I was thorough and not in a rush with it. When I rinsed it off my face felt somewhat tight and super smooth to the touch. When I looked up close in the mirror I was surprised. I have some larger pores on my inner cheeks and I get little clogs on my nose and under my lower lip. The clogs aren't super visible unless you're up in my face. They aren't really acne - not a black head not a white head. Idk how to explain it. Anyway after I rinsed and dried my face my pores were immensely shrunk, my nose and under my lip are perfectly smooth! I can't believe that was all drawn out??? I've used a sonic cleanser brush and dermafoliants and they help, but this instantly did a better job in that regard! I can't believe I!

I have to say that I really do like these contouring wraps from  Shape and Tone Body Products, I think the little heart shaped cut out for the belly button was a very nice touch.  I've been working to lose weight but even though I've managed to lose about 15 pounds so far I was a little upset over the loose skin so I was pretty excited to see if these would help and since they were delivered I've done 5 applications and I have to admit, I'm seeing results.  These wraps are a lot different from others I've tried - they are comfy to wear, they don't leave behind a sticky mess when you remove them and it actually feels like your skin is tightening up.  These wraps are fairly large too, so you can actually cut the wrap, depending on your size, and use it on your stomach area and have some left over for your upper arms, that's what I've been doing each time I apply and so far I see moderate changes in my upper arm area but hoping in time I see a lot more.  I apply my wraps before bed but you can use them any time that works for you, they can even be worn in the shower.  The package advises wearing these fairly consecutively in the beginning, I alternated every other day but you can do whatever works best for you.  This item was supplied to me at no cost during a promotion by the seller in order to evaluate and share my experience. All opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest & unbiased opinion.

3676,3,"12 26, 2009",A2DG9F8YOXNY7Y,B001AJ8YGC,"I've been using these Norelco shavers for years.  They last 3-5 years and then I get a new one; method of death typically involves worn out battery or getting smashed in a fall to the floor.  This is the latest one that I bought a couple weeks ago, and I've been the least satisfied with it so far.

First, it lacks a ""needs charge"" indicator.  While it appears to have two LEDs on the front, which I took to mean one LED for ""charging/charged"", and one for ""needs/low charge"", it's really just one indicator made to look like two.  An unfortunate related problem:  Norelco describes the ""needs charge"" or ""low charge"" indication simply as a ""charge indicator""; hey Norelco, that's insufficient English, because it could be taken to mean ""chargING indicator"".  When I was looking at buying one of these, I didn't realize that ""charge indicator"" in the description meant what it actually means.

Second, Norelco's descriptions of their shavers no longer tell you what kind of battery is inside.  Is it NiCd or NiMH?  Which one matters because you can run a NiCd battery all the way down without problems, but if you do so to a NiMH you are actually damaging it.  Repeated deep discharges of NiMH will kill it.  For that reason I actually prefer the older NiCd batteries because I can run them all the way down, and don't care about the quicker charge feature of NiMH batteries.  The only indication that it's probably a NiCd is that the manual says ""battery performance is best if you recharge only when the batteries are (almost) completely empty.""  Here's hoping.

All that said, I may very well keep this shaver.  I'm on the fence and trying to give it a chance.",1261785600,0,0,1,0,0

Well, they are NOT lined with plastic, and the hand cream DID soak into them.  I put my regular application of hand cream on, and worked it in, and then, prepping for sleep, I put a big glob on my hands and rubbed it all around, sort of like you do on the face with a mask or hair with deep conditioner.  But the gloves are snug; some of the cream actually was pushed down to my wrist by the action of struggling into the gloves, and the rest of it soaked into the glove fabric once I had the gloves on.  I took them off a few minutes later because they were so tight on my hands (I wear size 7 gloves so my hands are not that outrageously big.)

Anyone who is a slow cooking fan knows it can be a challenge to clean the pot or crock used. Using Dawn Ultra for Soaking loosens stubborn food considerably in a couple of hours. I think it is not quite as effective as Dawn Platinum but still an effective soak.

The scent of Dawn Ultra Original Scent is not unpleasant and is mild. Platinum's scent is more mild and for me less is better.

Both Dawn Ultra and Platinum require less product than Original in my experience. Less frequent purchases save shopping time and money. Both a plus.

The biggest differences for me between Dawn Ultra and Platinum are Platinum drying out my hands  and Platinum may be better for soaking.  In the summer when I'm not soaking as much I think Dawn Ultra is the best choice. Less drying out for the hands. In winter it's much closer. Ultra is a bit better as a soak.

I think Dawn Platinum and Ultra are very close in terms of cleaning. Both are an improvement over Dawn's Original formula dish washing liquid and worth a try.

My son has a medical device (dex cgm) that includes a sensor attached to his body that is a little bigger than the larger nail wraps.  It gets boring and it's nice to change up how it looks a bit.  The larger nail wraps do a great job of changing it up and adding a little fun at times to the dull medical device.

These nail wraps are a little smaller then others we've had so they don't  cover the entire sensor quite as thoroughly as others we've used, but it's decent.

Nail wraps work much better than stickers or things like that.  Nail wraps look more like they are painted on, like they belong there vs stickers.  Plus this devices gets a lot of wear and sticks don't last and look awful quickly.  We also typically cover the sensor with a clear tape and it sticks to  stickers and so even covered they come off as soon as the tape is removed.  Nail wraps, are more oa nail polish and last a long time - they can last a few months if you don't decided the change it sooner.

While the Tattify wraps are a little small, I LOVE that they offer a lot of boy and make teen appropriate designs.  The hard part of changing the look of medical devices has always been finding designs that a boy and especially a mail teen likes.

The second use - we have a teen daughter.  Our son gets the bigger ones for his sensor, our daughter gets the small ones for her nails.  It's a great double use and win win all around.

My hair is extremely dry after washing and letting it air dry (even though I always add a leave-in and oil). So, I decided to use this to help moisturize and twist my hair. I could just feel my hair going from super dry to extremely soft and moisturized from just one application of each section! I also applied this over castor oil, which I applied to my hair beforehand. (I use the L.O.C. moisturization method).

I then twisted my hair and applied this generously (my twist outs always come out better when I'm more generous with my product of choice). After 10 hours or so, I took out my twists and had a very well-defined twist out! There was absolutely no frizz - even after separating each twist (I undo the twist and the split each section in half). I'm really happy with the results.

The pics I'm included are of a two-day-old twist out  (I forgot to take a pic on the first day) and my hair still looks great - a little frizzy from sleeping on it, but nothing horrible. I just spritzed on a little leave-in conditioner to refresh my hair and it looked just as good as the first day. This cream is wonderful and allows me to easily go 4-5 days on one twist out - something that many other products just don't do for my hair.

This has a really sweet, pleasant smell to it. It's a white cream that's on the thick side, but very easy to work with and absorbs nicely into the hair - doesn't just sit on top. I also love that it doesn't make my hair feel all crunchy or crispy. My twist out was really soft and my curls were bouncy.

Sometimes my legs look down right pasty, sometimes I have a tan, (occasionally from the sun, usually from sunless tanning sprays) so my color changes and I've also noticed my arms are always darker than my legs. (I am sure this is normal, I hope this is normal..)
-In my opinion, all three offer great coverage. Given the limited amount of product shades available versus the abundance of different skin colors that vary from person to person, and even vary in one individual due to sun exposure or tanning products, its a safe bet that most will not find their perfect color in one bottle. If you want the closest match, you will have to do some color mixing.

AIRSTOCKINGS:
  PROS:
  -Very little to no transfer:
  CONS:
  -Color doesn't seem natural to me. Too pink.
  SUMMARY:
  -If it wasn't for the color issue, it would be my favorite.
COLOR:
  -They offer three colors. Listed from light to dark: Natural, Terra Cotta and Bronze.
  -I've used all three. Colors seem to have more of a pinkish tone, this is great if you have cool coloring. Right now the natural is the closest of these that match and its a little too dark, just a tad, but when blended in, its not THAT obvious.  When I am darker, I mix the terra cotta in a little. Its harder to mix because it dries faster (like the Nyce Instant Nylons) so you have to work fast.
  -Their colors are my least favorite, they just don't look natural on me.  The Natural shade by itself makes my legs look pink from afar and the shade is too different from the color of my arms.
APPLICATION:
  -Says to spray on legs then use your hands to blend it in and they advise you let set for 1-2 minutes. I guess it has the potential to rub off in that time.  Regardless of how long it takes to ""set"", it dries pretty fast and to mix the colors you have to work fast.
TRANSFERABILITY:
  -Beats the Sally Hansen hands down. I've sat on black leather seats on a hot day, resulting in my legs sweating and saw no transfer. Downright impressive.

  PROS:
  -Nice colors (a little on yellow side)
  -Of the three, offer best color selection (5 shades vs. 3)
  -Easy to mix colors.
  -Easy application.
  CONS:
  -Color transfer, of the three the most easily rubbed off.
  SUMMARY:
  -Nice colors but don't like that it transfers so easily.  I used it for a long time but after trying the Nyce and Airstockings, my expectations have been raised.
COLOR
  -They have five colors. Listed from light to dark: Nude Glow, Light Glow, Medium Glow, Tan Glow and Deep Glow.
  -Ive used their Nude Glow, Light Glow and even Medium Glow depending on the color of my legs. Right now, being winter, my legs are pretty white and the closest match is the Nude Glow. The Light Glow is too dark and looks too orange on my skin. When my legs are tanner, I've mixed the Nude Glow with the Light Glow and even the Light Glow with the Medium Glow but I am rarely that tan.
  -I prefer the colors of the Sally Hansen because they seem more natural, although a tad more on the yellow/orange side, and they have a better color selection. More colors, better odds of finding one that matches your skin color without mixing.
APPLICATION:
  -Directions say to spray on hands, then apply to legs and blend, then let set 60 seconds. I've done it both ways. Sprayed on hands, sprayed on legs. I end up blending the color on my legs either way so the results are the same but I guess there is less product getting everywhere if you do it directly on hands.  This brand has been the easiest to mix colors with.
TRANSFERABILITY:
  -This isn't as good as the other two when it comes to transfer.  It doesn't all rub off like makeup but, of the three, it rubs off the most and if you are sitting in your car on a hot day or just by sliding out, you will see some on your car seat...and your clothes.  If you have black leather seats, sit on a towel or something you don't mind getting dirty....

  PROS:
  -Little to no transfer:
  -Neutral colors (It leans towards yellowish but, to me, more of an in between of the Airstockings pink tones and Sally Hansen yellow tones)
  CONS:
  -Bottles clog.
  -Dries very fast.
  SUMMARY:
  -if it wasn't for the clogged bottle issue, it would be my favorite.
COLOR:
  -Offers three colors as well. Listed from light to dark: Nude, Medium Beige and Dark Beige.
  -I've tried the Nude and Medium Beige. Right now I use the nude and this is pretty close to my skin tone. I find that its not too orange and not too pink, it sits somewhere in the middle. When I am darker, I mix it in with the Medium Beige.  This brand is harder to mix colors because of the fast dry time.
APPLICATION:
  -Says to spray on legs and dries in 10 seconds (sounds about right..).  This is what makes it harder to mix, you have to work fast (faster than 10 seconds....)
  -The one thing I did not like was that the three bottles i've purchased have clogged at one point or another before I was finished with them. Two I managed to salvage. Once they clogged the first time, it became a repetitive issue, I keep having to clean the caps. I do this by dunking them in a mixture of water and facial cleanser, let it soak then use an old toothbrush to brush it clean. (I just got an ultrasonic jewelry cleaner so I am going to try dunking it in that next.)  Sometimes i have to clean it during application which is very inconvenient, especially when I am mixing colors.
TRANSFERABILITY:
  -Comparable to Airstockings, I saw little to no transfer.

MIXING COLORS:
-Mixing Nyce and Airstockings still gives a nice color with very little to no transfer.
-Mixing the Airstockings with Sally Hansen gives the nicest color (for me) and yields less transfer but there is still transfer nonetheless so I avoid using but when I am out of the either the Airstockings or Nyce, I will and just be more careful with transfer.
-I usually do a 50/50 mix just because its easier to spray them on my legs at the same time and can get consistent color through out, then blend them in quickly.

FINAL THOUGHTS
-Overall, I prefer to use the Airstockings and Nyce Instant Nylons to get the color I want, its a happy medium for me.  If you find airstockings to pink, neutralize it, lighten or darken it with Nyce colors.  If you find Nyce Colors too yellow, neutralize, lighten or darken with Airstockings and you, too, will find your happy medium.  Although the lack of transfer is impressive, I'd still be wary and wouldn't push my luck.  I have had some rub off on clothes but not sure if its because I didn't give it enough time to dry.  Because I mixed them, I can't pin point which one it was. I have all the colors I mentioned I've tried except for the Sally Hansen Airbrush Legs Nude Glow, if I figure out how to add a picture, I'll add a picture of a sample of each on my leg to see the color differences.",1356739200,0,0,0,1,0

I like that this soap mitt is two sided, offering a soft texture on one side like a cotton washcloth (for face), and a coarse ropey texture on the other side for everywhere else.

There may be some confusion on how to use this, so I'll explain briefly. You put a bar of soap in here, not your hand. There's a small velcro enclosure at the top of the pouch. When you first use it, you have to break it in a little but wetting the pouch and mushing the soap around until the mitt foams up. After that, it should lather when scrubbed against your skin during each shower.

Some people may find the shape of the mitt unwieldy. How I use it is to fold the mitt in half. That makes it very easy to hold and scrub.

1 star taken off for having a very small hanging loop. It's no longer than an inch and is not sufficient for hanging from the peg of my shower caddy.

Note that the product is not all natural. There's a sheet of man-made foam (polyurethane) inside to give it shape. It's not described on the page or the product image, but it is written on the tag inside the mitt.

With this mitt, I'm also finding that my showers are quicker because it takes less time to lather up and rinse off. Saving water is good for everybody.",1504569600,0,0,0,1,0

I used many different stampers and the firm stamper it comes with really worked the best.  You can see this on the swatch sheet I did; the two boxed in areas were done with the stamper that came with it.  I was pretty shocked it worked so well and did not need priming.  So, I'm quite happy to add this stamper to my collection.  The white stamper shown is the Uber Chic XL Non-Sticky stamper that usually picks up everything in great detail.
I tried using these plates with Wet N Wild black first, and not stamping polish, to see how well the images picked up.  The detail did pick up well but I found that some of the plates had large areas that were etched next to really find detail areas so sometimes the card would get stuck.  The metal scraper that came with the set was not helpful at all.  It is metal and as I feared completely scratched the plate and got stuck in some of the large areas I mentioned.  I just used a gift card like scraper and got better results.
This is also not a set from one manufacturer.  It appears its a hodge podge of collection of plates and my set had a duplicate which is pictured below.  Also, one plate was rusted under the blue film.  I have not contacted the manufacturer about this.
I tried to go for the finest details on each plate for the swatch and for the life of me I could not get the suckers from the octopus to all come out.  The blue portion of the swatch is Mundo de Unas stamping polish which did not even make that portion better.
Most of these plates stamped well though, you can see this on the swatch image.  I was impressed that I was able to get the watermelon seeds with regular nail polish.  I was however really dissapoined that one was damaged and I only received 9 distinct plates.

It is refreshing and effective against germs and plaque without using chemicals common in commercial products that can harm you.  I especially appreciated the small, round cardboard box that the oil arrived in.  Essential oils are sensitive to light, and this box protects the oils so that you can leave the Orawellness oil on the bathroom counter without worry that it will lose its effectiveness.

More than that, the people at Orawellness have an incredible wealth of information to share on dental health, and I encourage everyone to spend time on their site, enjoy their free dental health course and articles.  I found them to be very responsive to questions and comments, as well.  Honestly, you don't know what you don't know until you have spend time reading their articles.

It is fast and will get the job done, and for men that have to shave more than once during the day, it's great to just carry along in the car to do quick touch-ups, just charge it during the weekend then stick it in your car or briefcase for that quick second shave during the workday. The floating head is very comfortable, leaving no razor burn, and it definitely does the job faster than using manual razors. The ease in which the unit cleans is also nice. Simply rinse the head under water and let it dry in the charging stand. The Arcitec has a super long battery life along with a quick charge feature. When fully charged it doesn't have to go back on the charger for almost three weeks. This makes the unit very portable if you so desire. On the downside, it doesn't seem to shave as close though as a 2 or 3-head razor, and the trimmer is poorly designed and of little use. It's pretty pricey too, and debatable that the performance really warrants the price.

8971,4,"07 18, 2016",A3S5FRDKD52VBG,B01ERN0SRK,"This product arrived packed well in an Amazon box. The jar itself was in its own shrink-wrapped box. Unfortunately, when I opened it, the lid was cracked, probably during manufacture (see pic). There was a protective insert on top of the jar, so no product was lost. I was able to superglue the piece back in place, so no harm, no foul.

I purchased this mainly because I was interested in the effects of Red Ginseng and snail mucus in skincare. Red Ginseng is suppose to be the most potent and effective form of ginseng. It has been shown to ease dryness, reduce fine lines and wrinkles, and treat discoloration in the skin. Snail mucus also seems to be having a moment. Snail secretion filtrate in skincare is suppose to help with anti-aging by stimulating the formation of collagen and elastin, repair damaged skin, and restore hydration. However, even though this cream is called ""Red Ginseng Snail Face Cream"", a close look at the listed ingredients shows no snail secretion filtrate.

Ingredients
Water, propylene glycol, mineral oil, cetearyl alcohol, glycerol ester of stearyl alcohol (and) PEG-100 stearate, cetearyl glucoside and cetearyl alcohol, dimethicone (and) polydimethylsiloxane alcohol, butyrospermum park II fruit butter, cyclic polydimethylsiloxane, glycerin, allantoin, sodium hyaluronate, xanthan gum, polyacrylamide (and) C13-C14 isoparaffins alkanes (and) laureth -7, butylene glycol and water and PANAX GINSENG root extract, methyl ethyl thiazolinone, C114140, and 0177266 flavor.

Even so, it does have some good things like hyaluronic acid, allantoin and shea butter. I used the cream for a few nights and it is quite nice. The consistency is more of a gel-cream similar to Laneige water bank cream or Neutrogena Hydroboost. It spreads easily and absorbs after a few minutes. Its not greasy at all, but skin feels hydrated. I think it would be best for oily/combination skin or if you have dry skin and don't want a heavy feeling on your face, particularly during the summer. The color is a very light pink and it does smell very lightly of ginseng. I'm happy I tried it and will probably use it throughout the hotter months.",1468800000,0,0,0,1,0

- It's thick/dense - the bristles are tightly packed so it applies contour powder/foundation right where you want it
- Super soft - the synthetic bristles are really soft, making this brush feel wonderful against your skin.
- It works well!!  I had previously been using an eyeshadow brush to apply contour before trying this brush and I am really glad to have this one now because it is so much quicker and a more even distribution of product before buffing out.  It works well because you can use this to apply contour thick to then buff out with a kabuki brush or you can use this same brush and just apply a little contour and there is no need to buff it out after because this provides such a great even soft distribution if you want it to.

Overall I LOVE this brush and definitely recommend it.  It's an awesome price and so worth it.

The brush is a bright pink color, so it should be easy to find. It came well packaged and, enclosed in a hard plastic. Very easy to remove the plastic, and start brushing away.

For anyone with hair extensions this brush is perfect. It us also good with wigs and hair pieces. It did have a slight plastic odor outside of the box, but the odor dissipated after a bit.

What happened next was like a miracle. He would swallow these pills as soon after eating as possible, then again before bed time and at least once more the next day.

The set includes several stainless steel tools including scissors, nail clippers, cuticle trimmer, tweezers and a cuticle pusher. The set also includes a crystal nail file, which is actually very effective. I'm impressed! I've never used a file like this one before. Seem durable too.

All of the tools are housed in a teal (Tiffany's color) faux leather wallet. I wouldn't want to  throw this into a purse to carry around on a daily basis because the exterior of the case may take a beating. But I will be using this on a daily basis at home for nail grooming.

I love the way this set of nail tools by Solavae is packaged and presented. The case is a nice quality  almost a quilted, soft feel  and stays closed when you close it. There's a little push button to open it. The tools are secured in the case with elastic bands and they definitely won't come out unless you want them out. The stainless used on the metal feels nice in the hand and looks like brushed, matte steel, which makes it feel rich.  One last thing  the tweezers actually work and that's a rarity in manicure sets. They are really aligned even with the slanted tip. Amazing. (That never happens.)

Overall, this is a beautiful little manicure set that is appropriate for gift giving at a reasonable price. Great for stocking stuffers.

I'm not going to get too technical with my review because I see others have pretty much covered that department. Now as far as the effectiveness and convenience of the Nano Ionic Facial Steamer it's basically got all bases covered in that department as well..I love it and how well it moderates the amount of steam and the temperature. Believe it or not I also have a garment steamer/facial steamer so that's what I am comparing it to and this little guy is a real dynamo. So if you're looking to buy a facial steamer I give this one my seal of approval! With that said I did get it for Free in exchange for my honest review but, don't worry I always give my honest feelings on things and I feel this is a very nice quality facial steamer! Thanks and have a great day! ~Kiki",1461110400,0,0,0,0,1

This has both an exfoliating and a moisturizing effect on skin. I used it on my elbows, feet, collarbone area and upper arms. It doesn't irritate the skin but you will be rosy from a combination of exfoliation and better circulation in the scrubbed area.

The fragrance takes a moment to acclimate to. It took a second to recognize the coffee scent. I really appreciated it most while I stirred it before using it.

You don't need a lot of product to do the job plus this is a solid product meaning the coffee doesn't dissolve the way the sugar will so you will want to be careful with your drains. I'm not sure how this will affect the plumbing if you use a lot of it at once.

I really really love this product and feel lucky to have had the opportunity to try it.

PROS:
Synthetic, so they are completely cruelty free. It also means that generally speaking, the risk of getting a randomly bad peice is way lower.
Colorful: these strands are super vibrant, which would also be hard to achieve with real feathers
Easy: the application is incredibly easy
Versatile: due to the application process, you can pretty much put them on anyone's hair. As long as they have 1/2 an inch of hair, they can wear these extensions.
Less damage: because there are no chemicals, you are not risking anywhere near as much damage to your hair.
Commitment free: because the process of installing and removing is so fast and easy, you can put them in and take them out whenever you want!

CONS:
The only cons I can see about this particular kit is that 1) there are no pliers included and 2) the hook is a little thin.

The other thing to mention is NOT unique to this kit, but is true for every micro-link extension product...it can damage hair if the hair is too thin or fragile. I put these in to my daughters hair and then removed them to avoid damage. But, the model included in my video is continuing to wear them because her hair is thicker and can handle the micro-links. Use your discretion when deciding how to wear them.

All in all, I do really like these feather extensions and would recommend them to others. They are so versatile and bright, easy and quick.

My only complaint is that trying to straighten hair that hasn't been brushed is difficult, so make sure you brush your hair first. It also tends to leave my hair a bit frizzy, so I have to use smoothie cream to counteract that.

Now for the 'rest of us', this product is just silly. I am a fan of a lot of bliss products. This one turned my stomach. I volunteered to try it out for an honest review. I found the color to be ok.

With that said, if you are looking to have perfectly smoothed out thighs once you spray this on, then do not spend your money. Yes, skin does tighten, but it is like spraying alcohol on your face and then waiting while the skin pulls taught. This can't work enough to pull out dimples. Certainly not many dimples.

Afterwards, my skin feels so soft pliable. Not over dried and taut like most soaps. I truly appreciate the natural ingredients and lack of artificial fragrance. There is a distinct scent - it smells deliciously green and minty - but you can tell it's from the ingredients, not some harsh synthetic.

Unfortunately I haven't noticed a huge change in the quantity of blackheads on my skin or a reduction in pores, so I can't exactly call it a miracle product. The directions suggest using it once a day, every morning. I have been following that routine pretty well (it's the perfect cleanser to wake you up and make you feel refreshed) but I continue to use my more powerful cleanser at night since I have acne-prone skin. This seems to work out nicely. Personally I would recommend this product more for aging skin or those who do not have to worry about breakouts. I don't think it would CAUSE breakouts, but it doesn't prevent them from happening either, so unfortunately I have to keep up with my harsher stuff.

OVERALL: If you're sick of having painfully dry skin after washing your face, give this a try. It is super gentle, super hydrating, and makes you feel like heaven hours after the last splash of water. The bottle is fairly small, but it lasts a long time. I give it an above-average recommendation.",1404259200,0,0,0,1,0

Aloe Vera has so many uses and this specific one is Organic and All Natural which makes it even better. You get a huge 16 oz. bottle so this will last awhile. Aloe Vera Gel can be used on many different skin conditions including, Bug/Insect Bites, Eczema, Sunburn, Other Burns and Dry Skin. There are NO harmful chemicals, preservatives or perfume in this, it's ALL Natural!

The Nutrilab Naturals brand Aloe Vera Gel isn't as thick as some that you might have used before. That is due to it being made with all natural ingredients. This absorbs very well into your skin and aids in the healing process. Definitely loving this since it's summer and bug and sunburn season and 100% recommend this one to everyone.

First for getting a smooth shave with an electric razor and then I discovered it worked very well if I used this on my skin before I used shave cream. Makes the shave even smoother and surprise - my razor blades last 3 or 4 times longer. I think it has a silicone oil in it that coats the steel keeping regular razor blades sharper longer.

These are actually made from a cotton blend jersey knit, which grips my hair better.  The seams are all good, and unlike the spandex headbands, which had GLUED ON tags, these have sewn in tags.  So the overall quality is much better, and the headbands are more comfortable to wear.  I received 3 black and 2 grey, as pictured in the product image.

The product description says these are 5 inches wide, but they're really closer to 4.5 inches, not that it matters to me.  The diameter is 8 inches. I have really smooth, slippery hair, so these headbands don't stay on all that well, but they still work for my purposes, since I use them to push my hair back when I wash my face.  I've tried to sleep in them so that my hair is away from my face (which helps avoid breakouts) but they don't stay on very well.  They end up around my neck or somewhere on the pillow!

I'd love to be able to wear these for running, but they won't stay on my smooth head of hair---but I'm guessing people who have more hair texture won't have a problem.  If you're looking for a sure-grip headband, you might need to keep looking, but if you're just looking for a wide, comfortable headband that won't leave hard dent marks in your hair, these aren't bad.

8882,3,"08 9, 2016",A3TWPW6C78JPGV,B01D5G7PB2,"I have been critical of this brand in the past, and remain so now.  I am going to repeat the concerns that I've previously shared in the context of the 50% Lactic Acid Peel, because the issues still exist.

1.) There's no credible information.  No website, no record of Dr. Song, no record that ""Dr Song"" possesses medical training. Googling yields only a skimpy myshopify page with just 3 products, NONE of which is this face wash.  On the About Us page, there's only vague mention of it being a global pharmaceutical company, using pharmaceutical grade ingredients.  And yet, the only way to contact them is a single email address.  Any reputable company providing consumers with ""pharmaceutical-grade"" anything would have at least one support hotline for customers in case of adverse reaction or usage questions.

2.)  If this indeed contains 10% Benzoyl Peroxide,  then it sounds awfully high, as if it should be administered by a professional, and not by unskilled individuals without the benefit of any customer support resources.  Even the respected Murad brand doesn't go higher than 3.5%, and La Roche Posay and DDF top out at ~5%.  And all of those brands have trusted websites, customer hotlines, and prominently posted Hours of Operation.

3.)  Given the lack of credible information, it seems foolhardy to play with ""pharmaceutical grade"" products. However, as a person with very oily skin, I gamely gave this product a try.  The texture is thin and creamy, and it doesn't foam.  The smell is not great. It cleans well, but is very drying, to the point of leaving skin flaky. It takes some effort to rinse.  And you DO want to rinse twice.  Since I posed a question to the Q&A section, and got only a half-correct answer, I will answer myself right here:  Yes, any residual product *will* bleach clothing, pillowcases, and hair ON CONTACT.  How do I know this?  Because it unequivocally says so right on the bottle.  So that's a specific risk and opportunity cost for dark haired people, and it would have been good to be clear about that upfront in the product information.

So once again, having no other information to go on, it would be reckless to give this product more than 3 stars.  If you don't have sensitive skin, and have a devil-may-care attitude toward medical qualifications, then maybe this face wash works for you.  For me, it's risky and not particularly a joy to use, however, I can see trying it on less sensitive areas such as the upper back region.

I have been looking for a shampoo and conditioner that will help my hair be healthier and appear a bit more full. Toward this goal I had been using&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nexxus-Humectress-Conditioner/dp/B0007NIRUU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nexxus Humectress Conditioner</a>&nbsp;for decades, but they changed the formula and now it is terrible.

I came across Biolage Fortetherapie Strengthening Conditioner while searching for a good replacement for my old-formula&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nexxus-Humectress/dp/B0007NIRUU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nexxus Humectress</a>&nbsp;conditioner and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nexxus-Youth-Renewal-Rejuvenating-Shampoo/dp/B00AE07FUE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Shampoo</a>&nbsp;(which had a scent I didn't like and led to a strange incident covered in that review).  I replaced the shampoo with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Matrix-Biolage-Strengthening-Shampoo/dp/B003V2P32Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Matrix Biolage Strengthening Shampoo</a>&nbsp;which seems a set with Fortetherapie conditioner.

I've tried several other conditioners that were not really satisfactory and some just not acceptable.  Fortetherapie was like a breath of fresh air and left my hair feeling very nice. The scent is very mild and sort of like bamboo. It is almost no scent which pleases me.

With my below shoulder hair I used dollop about between the size of a nickel and a quarter then rub my hands together and work it throughout my hair. This amount seems to work well and helps make it easier to get my shower comb through my wet hair. It's not really a detangling conditioner for me, but it helps a lot and that is plenty good for me.

Rinsing it out takes longer than I expected. Hotter water helps clear it faster but too-hot may not be good for hair or scalp. I'm slowly trying to use less and less till I hit the right balance.

The bottom line is using&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Matrix-Biolage-Strengthening-Shampoo/dp/B003V2P32Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Matrix Biolage Strengthening Shampoo</a>&nbsp;and Fortetherapie Strenthening conditioner is leaving my hair and scalp feeling and looking better than I expected. My hair looks and feels clean longer and is very manageable.

I'll update the review with observations about the ""strengthening"" properties as I live with Fortetherapie conditioner longer.

First impressions are very positive and hopeful. I hope this will be helpful, especially for those of us who loved the original formula Nexxus Humectress conditioner.

Update: Jan 9 2014
Because of the rinsing issue I mentioned in the main review I have been using less and less of the Biolage conditioner each shampoo. I'm now using about half what I started with and it rinses easier and my hair looks and feels at least as nice.

What I'm using now seems less than what I would have thought would be effective. But happy surprise: it's like getting twice as many shampoos for the same money. It seems like my Biolage conditioner keeps getting better and better.

Update: Feb 15 2015

I think I'm using a little less than in the January update. A little less than a rounded nickel sized blob. This seems about right for my below shoulder length hair. I also can risse this amount more easily without resorting to very hot water. After a couple of months I feel my hair is either stronger or less likely to tangle and break. Whatever the case I got the same positive result.

Do they work? YES!
Do they last? NO!

Except for this one. It has outperformed the others.
First, a bit about these brushes. They come in a number of shapes and paddles, but are similar in that they have the same kind of plastic bristles.
The bristles stagger in length, and painlessly smooth knots and tangles.
Most of the time the bristles start to bend and then the brush is useless. After months of hard use, this one is still good as new.

These are a favorite with parents of kids with unruly hair, because they don't hurt.
I like it for myself, and it's also my 'secret weapon'.

I have 2 Maltese dogs, one is in full coat. That means long, flowing hair to the ground. Most people with a Malt in full coat need to section off the coat and roll up the hair, otherwise it gets so tangled it needs to be cut.

I'm an African-American female with kinky coily hair, very particular of my haircare regime. I'm not sure of my exact type, I just know my hair is the type that thrives on moisture. I never go longer than one week without cleansing my strands and sometimes I cleanse every other day. My scalp is very sensitive though with too much shampooing becomes irritated. Co-washing (using conditioner to clean my hair instead of shampoo) has become routine for me and I am constantly looking for conditioning cleansers that perform their best on my hair; maintaining moisture and not stripping natural oils. I found Pomifera Cleansing Conditioner on Amazon and decided to give it a try. Almost immediately I was hooked.  One of one of the main things that caught my attention to this product was the fact that it is Sulfate, Paraben, Gluten, & Phosphate free. Pomifera Conditioner produced teeny-tiny bubbles that seemed to help me detangle my hair as I cleansed it. I used a routine much as I would with a regular shampoo.

One box lasts me at least a year, but I am not a fanatic about white teeth, maybe because I was blessed with good teeth. I will continue to use this product.",1394496000,0,0,0,0,1

4412,4,"05 22, 2009",A2PSC7LUNIDEAH,B001VEK1GW,"The Good:

*Decent dry shaver/trimmer that will trim the hair all the way to the stub.
*Adjustable heads for trimming to the desired hair lenght.
*Waterproof
*Durable design

The Bad:

*The blade defeats the purpose of the trimmer in many cases.

The Bottom Line:

This is a decent body groomer from Braun considering other choices out there(Norelco.)  This is one example however when a brand tries too hard to beat out their competition.  The dry trimmer is what you can expect from your body trimmer:  Shaves hair close, but not completely off.  So of course you say to yourself ""Well, that's what the Gillette blade is for, right?""  If you think about it, the  number one reason people buy a body groomer like this is because they get irritation while using a blade and here it is, sitting on top of a trimmer.  Therefore, if you are already comfortable using a blade, then there is no reason for you to get this.  For most, if you are getting irritation from a blade, then you will get irritation from using this blade as well.  However, if you rarely get irritations from blades and prefer to use shave/blade combo in the shower/bath, then this could be a good choice for you.  Other things to consider:  One full charge should last you for about 50 minutes.  Overall a decent choice, but certainly not for everyone.",1242950400,0,0,0,1,0

I feel like these head bands would be more cute and stylish, if they had less fabric at the top. I don't really like how the bunch fabric looks, but it isn't that bad.

I told them this in the store, as if it did any good.  SO, for all you out here who love the vanilla scent, try this, also sold on Amazon:

Monoi Tiare Tahiti Coconut Oil Vanilla -- 4 fl oz
Sold by: Express Health
$11.26

It is made in Tahiti and has a real vanilla bean in the bottom of the bottle.  Because it has coconut oil in it, it solidifies at 68 degrees, but all you have to do is put it into your hand and it melts.  It smells SO GOOD!  It also has Tiare flower scent in it that the Bath & Body Works formula had as well as Vitamin E and actual vanilla bean fragrance from a real vanilla bean.  It is only 4 ounces, but a little goes a long way and is only $11.26.  This is a body lotion and it smells awesome and is the closest thing to the B&BW formula I could find with a reasonable price tag.

I went from dry to oily to combination skin. Ive gone to the dermatologist, who put me on a regimen that has now made my skin the driest its ever been. I don't appreciate my skin peeling every afternoon, and Im also tired of putting harsh chemicals on my skin. I recently made to switch to all-natural makeup, and Ive been looking for a brand to switch to all natural skin care. Hence, I was excited when I got to try out the Living Nature line at a discount.
The first thing that attracted me to this product is the fact that its made in New Zealand. I had the pleasure of visiting N Zed a couple years ago, and it was refreshing to see the high standards that the country has on organics the lack of pesticides, hormones and additives seen in meat, and how much fresher and better everything there smelled and tasted. Having been there, I automatically trust the products produced there more than I would anywhere else.

I have been slowly noticing some fine lines creeping in below my eyes, and its been bothering me. Ive tried a lot of other skin serums that have not amounted to any sort of difference. If anything, I think my skin has been having some bad reactions to the chemicals in them. After trying this firming eye cream along with Living Nature's Skin Firming Serum for a week, Ive noticed that I look more rested. The lines under my eyes are less noticeable, and I feel like the hollows beneath my eyes are also less pronounced. I guess I just look healthier overall. Its obvious that my skin really did not like the chemical products that I previously used, as its really liking these all natural products!

I also have to mention that I really love the natural smell that the products in this line have. It reminds of hiking through Karangahake Gorge and all the plant life you could smell whilst walking next to the raging river: damp, tropical, fresh, exotic.

It looks like Ive found the brand to finally make the switch to all natural face products. Highly recommend!",1467676800,0,0,0,0,1

The advertisement states they are made in the USA but I cannot verify that based on the way they came to me. These are the perfect containers for the home crafter. The price point is much better on the larger volume of bottles.

My dog has been having really dry skin so I used one of these jars to make her a moisturizing body butter. Heres my recipe for my dogs butter:
1 ounce shea butter
1/2  ounce cocoa butter
1/2  ounce jojoba oil
1/4  ounce sea buckthorn oil
1/8 ounce tamanu oil
20 drops of lavender essential oil

I love to use plastic jars so they don't break on my tile floors. I would recommend these to anyone who likes DIY projects. Its nice to have a two pack but the pricing is too high so I would recommend purchasing the larger volume. You can use these for many different projects and save a lot of money by making your own products.

I received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. I do not guarantee 5 star reviews unless the product is one I would buy again and/or recommend to friends.

I purchased it as what I thought would be a special use product and didn't expect it to become a daily thing, but it exceeded my expectations and made me wish I gotten one years ago.  I initially got this because I wanted to irrigate gums and teeth during a bleaching process I was having done at the dentist.  My hope was that using this after bleaching would help limit the sensativity I was experiencing from the bleach residue from the home maint part of the process - just rinsing after was not doing a good enough job, and my gums were becoming irritated. This product did the trick and solved all the issues I had with the bleaching process.  In addition, I noticed an overall improvement in comfort when brushing and I didn't even know my gums could feel this great. I thought they already were fine, but this product just really improves overall dental health.  Love it.

I got this model because of the additional piks that come with the unit and the storage case for those small parts, as well as the smaller foot print - it just seemed better designed then the more basic unit. To me it has been worth the price.  Since this was my first water pik, I did go through the initial introductory process of drenching myself and the bathroom mirror on the first use, but after I got the hang of it found it very easy to use.  I use the regular pik and tongue cleaner the most and do use the product daily. The chord storage is great - the coil chord holds up and stays neat after use (could be a tad longer though).  I love the multi-speed adjustment but haven't had to go pass 4 yet for anything.  For me, this was a great purchase.",1203897600,0,0,0,0,1

PROS:
1. I WAS ABLE TO PICK MY COLORS AND DID NOT HAVE TO RELY ON THE WHIM OF A COMPUTER OR STOCK PERSON PICKING FOR ME
2 . I ASKED FOR TWO RED TOWELS, ONE GREEN TOWEL; ONE YELLOW TOWEL; ONE ORANGE TOWEL AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I RECEIVED
3. WHEN I MADE THE ORDER, I WENT TO THE BUTTON THAT SAID ""CONTACT SELLER""' WHICH LED ME TO AN EMAIL PAGE WHERE I PICKED THE COLORS AND NOTIFIED THE VENDOR
4. THE VENDOR REPLIED WITHIN AN HOUR AND LET ME KNOW THAT THOSE PARTICULAR COLORS WERE IN STOCK AND THAT HE WOULD SEND THEM OUT THE NEXT DAY
5. HE SENT ME THE NAME OF THE DELIVERER AND THE NUMBER OF THE TRANSACTION SO THAT I COULD FOLLOW THE PROGRESS AS SOON AS THEY WERE SHIPPED, WHICH WAS THE NEXT DAY
6. I ORDERED THESE ON A FRIDAY AND RECEIVED THEM AT 10:30 AM THE FOLLOWING MONDAY
7. THE COLORS ARE TRUE
8. THE FRINGE IS HEAVIER DUTY THAN THE TOWELS THEMSELVES WHICH MAKES THEM LOOK MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THEY WERE
9. VERY REASONABLY PRICED
10. A FAIRLY THIN TOWEL, BUT THAT WAS MY PREFERENCE AS THEY ARE FOR THE GUEST BATH WHERE PAPER FINGER TIP TOWELS ARE KEPT FOR THE DAY VISITORS AND THESE WILL GENERALLY ONLY BE USED FOR THE GUESTS I HAVE OVERNIGHT WHICH MAY ONLY BE 2-3 TIMES A YEAR

CONS:

1. I SUSPECT THAT THE FRINGE ON ANY OF THESE TOWELS WHETHER HIGH HIGH QUALITY OR OF THE LESS EXPENSIVE VARIETY WHICH I PICKED, WILL BE A CHALLENGE IN THE WASHER.
2. I PLAN TO HAVE MINE DRY CLEANED AND LET THEM WORRY ABOUT THE FRINGE...OR THE FRINGE MAY REQUIRE IRONING AS MIGHT THE TOWEL
3. I HAVE NOT WASHED THEM, DO NOT PLAN TO DO SO, SO I CANNOT ADDRESS THEIR COLOR FASTNESS; HOWEVER, SHOULD I WASH THEM, I WOULD USE THE PRODUCT ""SHOUT"" TO INSURE NO COLOR RUNNING

FOR ME,, THESE ARE A GODSEND. I AM REALLY TIRED OF BUYING REALLY EXPENSIVE TOWELS FOR THE FRONT BATH WHICH SIT AND SIT UNTIL THEY ARE USED. NOW I CAN HAVE THOSE NICE THICK TOWELS FOR MYSELF IN THE BACK WHILE HAVING AND INEXPENSIVE  BUT EXOTIC LOOKING PRODUCT IN THE FRONT!",1440979200,0,0,0,0,1

Starting with the design, this has a heavy, tip-proof base with a rubber (or perhaps neoprene) bottom. The weight and the bottom ensure that it stays put regardless of how wet your sink cabinet top becomes. Plus the forks for holding your razor and brush will fit just about any model of either.

It's the construction that I love. Heavy, chrome and the knurled part of the post is a wonderful masculine touch with a true function. It will not slip from soapy hands if you want to reposition it. I mentioned that this stand's design showed attention to detail and the knurling is a prime example.

Since it is heavily chromed it's easy to keep clean and sanitary. For me that is a major factor. Plus the post can be unscrewed from the base for thoroughly cleaning it. When the post is screwed into the base, there is no indication that it's a two piece unit. It appears to be seamless, so that is one less place for bacteria to hide.

I apply the shower gel to wet body or scalp. Lather, rinse, and repeat. If using as a bubble bath, drizzle a generous amount under running water and enjoy.

It's amazing how much whiter they make your teeth after only a few days. I've been using them for a couple of years and decided to try the new ""Whitestrips Premium PLUS."" This product is exactly the same as the regular Whitestrips Premium, except the box it comes in has a window and it comes with 3 extra days of strips. The regular Whitestrips takes 7 days and this takes 10. After 7 days, your teeth are pretty much as white as they're going to get, and I didn't notice much of a difference from the additional 3 days. The ""Plus"" in the product's name seems to refer more to the much higher cost of this product.

If you're thinking about getting this, just realize that all it is is three more strips, so when you figure out how much you're being charged per strip, you may find you're paying considerably more for these poer strip than the regular Whitestrips Premium.

That being said, the strips are a great product and if you get them, make sure you buy some toothpaste for sensitive teeth because this product WILL make your teeth feel like they're on fire. It's definitely worth it though.",1120262400,0,0,1,0,0

This Firming Eye Cream by Living Nature uses the nourishing benefits of Manuka Honey and the soothing and plumping qualities of Harakeke Flax Gel to really help make this a potent Eye Cream!
I tend to use different Eye Creams in the morning than I do at night and this Firming Eye Cream is the perfect morning Eye Cream for me.  It's nourishes and moisturizes my under eye area but it's lightweight enough so it's quickly absorbed making it the perfect Eye Cream to wear under make up.  It also helps smooth out those annoying fine lines and that makes this all natural and organic Eye Cream a definite winner!  Being fragrance free also makes this Eye Cream a great choice for those with sensitive skin!

Supplements are almost always a tricky thing to evaluate, whether you're writing or reading a review.  Was it the supplement that made the difference, or something else that I also changed at the same time that I started taking/using it?  It's like folks that claim a diet pill really works for them, even though they started eating healthier and exercising at the same time they started taking it.  This oil is no different.  I don't know if it's actually made a difference for me, nor would I be able to say that it would help you even if I did think it helped me.

That said, I decided to evaluate this oil mainly because of the following - the company offers a 360 day money back guarantee.  That's tough to beat!  That lets you try it out yourself and decide if it works for _you_.

As for my personal experience with this, I can say the following:
(*) Product is very easy to apply, as you simply spray the liquid on to yourself.  It's called an ""oil,"" but it's very much like spraying or misting water on yourself from a spray bottle.  It's a little oily, but not bad at all
(*) I felt a little itchiness when applied to my torso, but none at all when applied to my arms and feet.  The itchiness was mild, and I may have only really noticed it because the product notes mention it might happen
(*) There was a very noticeable layer of salt residue left behind on my skin.  I wouldn't say that I would have been scared to walk by a herd of cows (""look, a salt lick!"")...well, any more scared than I'd normally be :D, but I was surprised the first time at just how much salt there was.  It was a pretty solid layer in areas
(*) I haven't yet noticed any changes in regards to aches/pains/anything, but I've only used it a few times

Because of the layer of salt left behind, I suggest using this before you bathe.  Spray it on, give it a few minutes to absorb, then shower/bathe as usual to get the residue off.

I give it five stars for ease of application and having no financial risk because of the guarantee, but I give it four stars overall because of the amount of salt residue left behind.  If the product intrigues you, I'd say go for it because of the guarantee.",1423958400,0,0,0,1,0

I confess that in the past I have washed with my wifes Dove bar.  I loved the scent and the luxury of it.  But it was a little too strong and slippery for me, and it didn't do too well when I was really dirty.  This mens Dove has a great spicy masculine scent and really does a great job of deep cleaning.  I have used both the fresh and the deep cleaning and prefer the deep cleaning.  The extra fresh I would recommend for those that really need a deodorant soap.  In either case however, one thing I really love about this soap is its ability really get you clean, and at the same time moisturize your skin.  Dry skin is a real problem for many here in New England in winter when the air is so bone dry.  Washing down with this really has helped, and, unlike the ladies Dove, you really feel clean in spite of the moisturizing ability.  Trust me guys, a cake of this stuff will spoil you.  It's great.

The only thing I can say that I don't like about this soap is that it gets used up very quickly.  In no time it seems the bar is down and its time to crack open another one.  Gets a little expensive in an area that most of us don't consider a budget to be much of a factor.  But for what it is and does, this Mens Dove is well worth the expense, and is an excellent soap that I highly recommend... : )",1360540800,0,0,0,0,1
1730,4,"07 9, 2008",A2V0I904FH7ABY,B000UK2VRK,"One truly outstanding feature of this shaver is an inbuilt moisturizer dispenser, which you can control while you shave.

While an electric shaver is much safer than a traditional razor, even an electric shaver can leave some burns on your skin and make it rough if you do not apply enough moisturizer.  This razor makes it so much more convinient to make this happen.

Electric shavers are a bit hard to like them if you are migrating from a traditional razor - usually because your skin will need some time to get used to it.  Give it some time - typically about 3-4 weeks for your skin to get used to it and then you will like it.

If you are buying this to replace another electric shaver - this is a very good choice for the price.  While one of the other Norelco models - Norelco 1090 costs upwards of $200, I can say that this model 8040x is a steal of the money - the moisturizer feature makes every penny worth.

+ ves:
 + I have to say inbuilt moisturizer dispenser is the best feature
 + Well designed, light weight and easy to use
 + Good battery life
 + Very little noise

- ves:
 - The moisturizer dispenser should have been made automatic, instead of manual control
 - I do not think the cost of moisturizer refills should be that high, but it would be better if Philips Norelco suggests additional moisturizer that can be used in place of the Nivea. (nothing against Nivea, but trying to look for cheapter alternatives)",1215561600,0,0,0,1,0

Don't charge/clean it every day. If you want your battery to last, do what I do! Only clean it in the Jet Clean when your battery level is at the bottom bar. Tap out cuttings once in the middle of the cycle and once just before cleaning. In fact, run it under the sink before you clean it. Your cleaning solution will last a very long time and you'll only need to clean the solution tray once when you change the fluid. The nice thing about the tank is you can pull it out to check it. When it's about empty, clean the tray and refill the tank. I've only used 6 bottles of cleaning fluid in 4 years.

The cleaning solution also lubricates the blades and it works! After two years, I bought new blades and there was NO DIFFERENCE to the old ones I replaced just because of their age. I wasted my money, the Jet Clean lubrication works that good, even only using it between full battery charges.

Also, after four years, my battery life is still around two weeks. You won't get this type of battery life if you charge this thing in the cleaner every day. Obviously, don't EVER just leave this thing in the charger as it will ruin the batteries. Besides, the blades won't dry out there anyway.

Also, don't, and I repeat DON'T EVER get the cleaner/ charger circuitry wet. If you do, give it two days to dry out before you plug it in again or the cleaner will be quite erratic in it's operation and could quite possibly burn out.

I've had four Norelco razors in my lifetime and this is BY FAR the best! When the new models came out, I actually saw no need to upgrade. For me? That's saying something!

I do not think that there are any miracle creams out there that are going to make you look decades younger, and I find most of the hype surrounding many anti-aging products is just that - hype, with no science to back it up.  That being said...

SK-II is a well-known, high-end skin care line and I was excited to give it a try.  This product arrived without any instructions, which I find odd.  Does it replace your toner or do you use it after your toner?  I had to go online to the company's website to do a little research.  You apply this product to clean skin.  You can use a cotton pad or pat it into the skin with your hands.  It absorbs into my skin quickly and completely; there's no sticky feeling nor is it oily.  It has the consistency of water and a very slight (and not unpleasant) odor.  I experience no stinging, redness, irritation or breakouts.  This does leave my skin feeling a little tight, and I follow up with my usual daytime moisturizer and nighttime retinol cream.

After nearly four weeks of use (twice daily) I have to say that I've noticed absolutely no change in my skin whatsoever.  Now I'm pretty happy with my current skin care regimen, and it's entirely possible that what I'm using is effective and I'm not going to see any major changes by adding another product into the mix.

Bottom line:  Pleasant and easy to use; no unwanted side effects but also no noticeable improvement.

Would I recommend this product?  Hard to say.  Everyone's skin is different and I've read online testimonials by women who swear by this stuff.  Since it didn't do anything for me, I can't be too enthusiastic about it, and frankly I find the price a bit prohibitive.",1424390400,0,0,1,0,0

This is a smooth, creamy, nice-smelling product that seems to really and truly be helping my cellulite. I am 5'2"" and I weigh a firm, fit, muscular 125 pounds. I am also 43 years old and a mother of 3. Being as small as I am, I expected a few stretch marks with my pregnancies. I actually got lucky and ended up with very few stretch marks, but I did earn a little cellulite in my belly. Particularly around an old scar from where I had my appendix out at age 15. For whatever reason, this scar has become decidedly attached to some very stubborn fat cells. No matter what exercises I do, or how much cardio I do, this little scar retains a firm hold on an ugly little bubble of cellulite, and it's one of the few places I got a handful of stretch marks.
I have tried tons of products over the years, and never had much success. Now, I'm not saying this product is a miracle, because it isn't. My cellulite and stretch marks didn't disappear over night, or even in a week. But I have noticed some improvement, and I'm certain it isn't wishful thinking. I never hold much hope for any of these products, so that I'm never too disappointed. Also, I've stared in the mirror at this ugly little place on my body for years now. There has definitely been improvement.
This cream also makes my skin soft, and that's always a plus. At $22.00 for 4oz, I certainly wouldn't buy it as an all over lotion, but for spot treating stretch marks and cellulite....definitely.

For the last 6 years, I've have a closely trimmed full beard because I've always disliked shaving. I have sensitive skin and full beard, and could never shave everyday without significant irritation, blade or electric shaver, and I can't shave against the growth with a blade because of irritation. In the early to mid-80's, I tried using a Norelco and shaved dry with a pre-shave lotion (Williams Lectric Shave), but it never gave me a great shave.
This shaver is different and provides a great shave -- very close and comfortable with little to no irritation, and it did this from the very first shave -- no waiting the three weeks Norelco recommends for your skin/beard to adjust. I've used the shaver both in and out of the shower, and it works well both ways. But I find it works best in the shower using Nivea's shaving gel which you can get pretty cheaply (I bought a 7 oz. can of shaving gel for $2.50 at local grocery store). The Nivea shaving gel for my money works better than the Nivea conditioner and you don't have to keep dispensing the gel once applied to the face.
The only negative comment has to do with the battery and the 8-hour charge time. If purchasing this again, I would step up to the 8040X just to cut the charge time in half and get the quick-charge feature and indicator light when charge is full.

I worried when I saw the stickers that the wet environment would mess them up, but since they go UNDER the clear plastic removable front panel, they have held up fine.

The rest of the brush is pretty similar to any other sonicare brush. I have 3 others. All my family members use them and I have them in different bathrooms just so we can be more inclined to brush our teeth more than when we are upstairs in the morning and night. The brush DOES have a setting for a ""softer"" sonic experience for younger kids who may find the other setting too much. My kids never had that problem. It also has a little electronic ""musical"" noise after each of the 4 timed periods. You are supposed to concentrate on one quadrant for 30 seconds, then move on to the other three. So after 30 seconds, you get a little jingle. Then after one minute, you get a slightly longer jingle...then after 1:30 a longer one...then one more sound and the thing shuts off. I am not sure the sound will entice my kids to WANT to go get the toothbrush, but it does help with making sure you hit each part of your mouth with sufficient time. I have another sonicare toothbrush without any sound...and I really miss it!!

I like it for myself actually. The brush head is nice an small (which I like) and it holds its charge WELL. I really only charge it once every few weeks. You can keep it in the charger stand, but we really don't have room for that so I keep that in the linen closet until we need to charge overnight.

Both sudz up nicely with body wash and should work well with salt or sugar scrubs as well. It is easy to slip on and has a handy loop for hanging and drying in the shower.

The natural bamboo and jute mitt is a little small on my hand (6ft tall man) but it works. It should be fine on smaller hands. I'm a hairy guy and some of my body hair does attach itself to the mitt even after thoroughly rinsing and wringing out. That doesn't bother me, but it might limit shareablity with my wife. I also worry that over time it might get a musty smell since it takes a while to dry, but as long as I keep using it with soap, I hope that it won't be an issue.

The good thing is that overall as a unit, the toothbrush works very well. Setup is quick and easy, so you don't have to worry about actually putting anything together. You do have to snap one little part on the charger, but that's optional and not really necessary unless you have multiple people that will be using the base of the toothbrush. The speed was nice and was fast enough to get a nice deep clean, but not so fast that it would feel harsh on the gums. Now the only drawback is that you aren't given a target amount of charging time. The instructions say that if the light blinks red then you must charge for 40 minutes before the toothbrush can give you a 2 minute clean, but this doesn't say how long you would have to wait if your unit is completely drained of power or how long it'd take to charge completely. This is a somewhat small thing, but it can make a big difference if you're looking to use it right away or give it a quick charge to take on the road. It's just a little annoying, although I'd guess that this was more because the instructions were so general because it was used for a wide line of electronic toothbrushes with various battery lives.

The toothpaste is pretty good. It's nice to look at as you squeeze it out, which believe it or not actually makes a difference with me. I've found that although this might seem shallow, I feel better when I have toothpaste that looks like something I wouldn't mind putting in my mouth. Of course I want something that actually works and would choose quality over style, but this toothpaste works very well. The Scope additive tastes nice.

As far as the dental floss and Scope goes, they're pretty standard. Scope is nice and I have to say that while Listerine will probably always be my number one favorite ""go to"" brand, Scope is up there. The dental floss is also good, it's the flat type which I know is not always everyone's favorite. It gets into the smaller crevices in my teeth that the thicker floss can't get into due to my having a crown or a filling, so I rather like the Glide. It didn't shred in my teeth, which is always a bonus.

Overall I'd recommend this to others. It's a bit expensive and the price for each thing separate on Amazon is almost the same price as this bag itself (except that the paste, floss, and mouthwash tend to come in bulk, which affects the price), so if the price is an issue I'd recommend just looking for the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/toothbrush/dp/B003UKM9CO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">toothbrush</a>&nbsp;and picking up the rest at your local store.

(Big hit = Cool Mist Diffuser.  Big miss = Cellulite Cream.) So I was slightly apprehensive when I was offered this product for free in exchange for a candid review, especially since I'm a scientist, and I'm tough when it comes to grading.  But this one earns 5 stars, for the simple face that it does what I need it to do, which is condition and soften my hair in way that leaves it shiny and un-frizzy.

For reference I have waist-length, healthy hair---each hair is very fine, but I have a billion of them, and they easily blow around my face in breeze because they're so lightweight.  So I want something that weighs my hair down, which I admit is probably not what most people are aiming for; but in order for my hair to hang nicely in a shiny sheet, it needs the right kind of moisture coating to temporarily smooth the cuticle and allow it to drape properly.

This conditioner is pretty rich---and it does smell like coconuts, but only faintly, which is fine with me.  I have to use quite a lot (like a handful) so this jar isn't going to last long, but then again, I have hair to my waist.  FYI:  this is not an instant conditioner.  It definitely needs a few minutes to work.  I didn't get out of the shower or anything (Who's patient enough to take a two-part shower in order to do a lengthy hair mask? Am I right?) but I did leave to sit in my hair for 4 minutes while I shaved my legs!  The good news is that it *does* leave your hair shiny.  I wouldn't say it leaves my hair softer than a drugstore brand, but I can get a brush through it pretty easily.

Now for the bad news.  I compare the ingredients of EVERY beauty and bath product I use against databases of comedogenicity (i.e. how easily these ingredients cause breakouts.)  This is because I live in San Francisco, where the water is very hard, and the dissolved minerals combine with skin oils, and comedogenic ingredients to form an invisible pore-clogging soap scum.  So I do my homework (and it's exhausting.......)  If you have acne-prone skin, let me share the findings so you don't have to do as much work as I did.  The online database acnemantra.com returned the following results:
----------
Found 4 acne causing ingredients:
Shea Butter is comedogenic
Argan Oil is comedogenic
Rosehip Seed Oil is mildly comedogenic
Coconut Oil is highly comedogenic
- See more at (...)
----------
If you're surprised to see coconut oil on that list, well...it's true.  Coconut oil is highly comedogenic and will cause breakouts if you have large pores that block at the drop of a hat.  I know some people rave about it, but they probably have dry skin and small pores.  The rest of us need to be very careful, because even a single comedogenic ingredient can spell disaster.  This one has four of them.  So you might be playing with fire.  It just depends what type of skin you have.  I think this is a good conditioner--I just need to be very careful to rinse twice, and not let any residue stay on my scalp, face, or body.  If you don't have acne-prone skin--then this is an even better fit for you. (you lucky devils.)",1456272000,0,0,0,0,1

I am totally partial to any grapefruit scent, and this product falls into line with my grapefruit obsession. It smells fabulous and leaves a scent on the skin, just what I like! It is a salty scrubber. I patted my face with water, placed a teaspoon of the scrub in my hands and scrubbed gently in little circles. It took about 30 seconds for the salty mixture to dissolve. I then washed off with warm water. I was nervous to do this multiple times because I had open acne with and without scabs. I thought that it would cause my acne to spread but it did not. The acne actually cleared up 50% after 3 uses of this product and did not further  spread. I followed the scrub with a cleanse, some toner, serum, and moisturizer. I looked in the mirror with good lighting after doing my makeup and noticed that my skin was smoother and I did look a few years younger. I had not exfoliated my face in 2 months prior to this, so I had some excess dead skin on my face. I am happy that my skin smelled good and that my acne seemed to clear up a little, and that I looked  slightly younger because of the exfoliation.

As the title says, the results are not instant, but by Day 6 they were visible (please see my photos showing the difference).

The eye cream definitely does a good job moisturizing my eyes, and I used it above and below them. As you can see, the eye cream didn't do much for the puffiness above my eyes. This leads me to believe that the eye cream needs the pads to work its magic. I took before and after pictures, shown side by side. But comparing the two, I could see the puffiness is definitely reduced by Day 6. I don't see much difference in the tiny crows feet at the outer corner of my eyes. I probably would have with continued usage if this were more affordable.

I do love the cooling feeling I that I experienced immediately after applying the pads under my eyes each evening. I also discovered, if I replace the film on the eye pads (the film is what keeps the pads from drying out), I can get one more use out of each pad (even experiencing the same cooling sensation the second night).",1444348800,0,0,0,1,0

I've tried a lot of different Argan Oil shampoo and conditioners (and sprays and masks and hot treatments etc) and I can 100% say this is my All time favorite for no other reason than how incredibly fast I'm seeing a difference in the ends and improvement on breakage. I color my hair and have been for close to 10 years now and just in the past year or so I've started having really bad problems with breakage and split ends. I've tried probably 10 different brands or more with some kind of argan oil treatment and it really helps. But I didn't get results like this from anywhere else, and I've tried some pretty pricey stuff. After like, 3 days of use I happened to look down at my hair one day and it just hit me that I didn't have any frizz  or areas that looked wild and untamed from breakage, the hairs that would normally have 2 or 3 splits or frays were just smooth all the way down. I tried to take a picture of the hair up close so you could see but couldn't get a clear shot at such a short distance. The color looks richer and has a healthy looking shine, it isn't greasy or stringy like you might worry about with Argan Oil.
This stuff even smells amazing! I usually like coconut scents, it's always been my favorite, but this smells more floral and a little spicy, which maybe sounds weird but I think it's soooo good.

It lathers up surprisingly well for an Argan Oil shampoo and I don't have to use much for my bra strap length hair. My hair is really thick, too, but a good quarter sized dallop works out to be about the right amount for me. I do the ends and body first and work my way up to my scalp, backwards from how I use regular shampoo. (I do this because some brands seem to leave my hair oily if I don't get it rinsed out well, that Argan Oil can be stubborn.) I usually let it set for a couple minutes while I wash my body so the hair can absorb the nutrients before I rinse it away. I follow it with their conditioner and my hair gets sooo soft when it dries. I really can't stress enough how well it helps my hair. I know everyone responds differently but for me, it's better than anything else I've tried. I'll be ordering this again for sure.

I did receive my Argain oil shampoo at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes. I was not paid for my review and was asked only to provide whatever feedback I may have about the product, whether it be positive or negative. I welcome both positive or negative feedback as well.

8860,5,"08 1, 2016",A2Y771VL7HT81N,B01CJEST9S,"I am recovering from eye eczema as a result of the prolonged sun exposure.  The skin under my eyes is extremely sensitive and get irritated quite easily.  I had undereye puffiness right after the sun exposure, but 2 months later, there is no puffiness but there are dark reddish circles under my eyes that look like bruises.  They prompted questions from people implying domestic violence.  Needless to say, I am quite obsessed with eye care products right now.  I tried many by now and ZesGood eye cream was one of them.

It arrived promptly after placing an order and was packaged in a attractive purple bottle with two pumps, one for a day eye cream, the other one for a night eye cream.  This is 2-in-1 eye cream.  It took several presses on the pumps before the cream appeared which is always the case with new products in the pump form.  The day cream is something between a gel and a cream, and the night cream is a true cream.  Both are easy to apply and stay where you put them.  They have thick consistency, white color, and a very light scent, barely noticeable.  I was not able to recognize rose in it, but I do not buy eye creams for the scent, although I have to admit that rose oil was what attracted me to this cream in the first place.  The cream got absorbed quickly and completely without leaving any greasy or sticky residue.  Both day and night versions are incredibly emollient and moisturized my undereye areas wonderfully.  Despite my eyes being extremely sensitive, the creams did not irritate them at all.  It felt really good on my undereye skin.  I did not use them long enough to report whether it is effective against dark circles but based on their hydrating properties I believe they will make a difference.  Each cream is 15 g, which is common for eye care products.  The outside box has both Chinese hieroglyphs and poorly translated English.  The ingredient list is in Chinese, but there are English abbreviations for DMDMZ(?) and EDTA, as well as a Latin name for Shea butter.  Overall, I was very pleased with these creams, and have a good feeling about their long term use.  I was very happy that they are gentle enough to be used on my eyes with eczema.

Each member that has it, has a different form, meaning everyone has to have a different kind of cream and soap to use so that they don't have as many flair ups. That can get pretty pricey! My 9 yo daughter alone cream is $22 a tub, and the others are not far behind that!

We have been using this Elbahya Organic Moisturizing Agran Oil Soap for near, a week, and I have been using it on everyone to be able to, compare the differences and the longer it goes that we are bathing with this Elbahya Organic Moisturizing Agran Oil Soap I don't have to apply their creams as much! Some nights i donrlt have to apply it at all! Here is what i have been doing...each night I bath the kids, and instead of ApplYing their creams right away, I wait until it is time for bed, when I lay them down I check them, if they have any kind of patches or places that are looking a little more rough than others I apply their cream. If they don't have any signs, I don't and check again in the morning. Within the week that we have been using this soap, I would say that our cream usage has been cut in half! I will update this later as I think by the time that,we finish this bar, we may be down to no creams! And that would be awesome, by saving time an money!

I also think it's not really practical for an office; how many opportunities in an average office are there to give yourself the kind of pedicure in which toe separators and a callous file would be involved?

My favorite way to use this is to combine with the Living Nature Body Wash.  I apply the Refreshing Body Lotion right after I get out of the shower while my skin is still slightly damp and the lotion is almost immediately absorbed leaving skin nourished.  The Shea Butter in it really does soften and soothe the skin and it's very long lasting.  I can put it on in the evening and it will last well into the next day. Also, because it's a light neutral scent it can be used by everyone in the family.
If you pair this Refreshing Body Lotion by Living Nature with their Nourishing Body Wash you have a match made in Heaven!

No need to run up your credit card anymore! Essie reintroduced SSN (that's for 'Starry Starry Night,' not your social security number) in its Retro Revival Collection, and the polish sold out online in a nanosecond. The good news is that it's just now coming into your local Essie retailer, so pick up a bottle or two as a backup.

This polish is worth the hype. It's amazing, kind of like a navy jelly base with the subtle silver glimmer of a million stars in a sky unmarred by light pollution. I absolutely adore it (and yes, I picked up a spare, since this polish is that wonderful.)

Unlike some reviewers' experiences, I found the formula to be fine, not thick, not goopy. I used a base coat, as you should with anything this dark to prevent staining, and I got full opacity in two coats. The polish last almost a week before signs of chipping, and even then, it was minimal. (Your mileage may vary.)

Old timers say that this isn't quite the same as the original SSN; that may be true, but ignorance is bliss in my case. I love this polish! (And I'm not bidding $$$ for the original, either.) Even if you don't normally gravitate towards dark polishes, give this one a try. I'm sure you'll love it, and if you don't...well, you can send it to me!

After about two weeks of use (especially during this harsh cold weather) I'm a believer in it's moisturizing benefits. Since it's a large bottle, I've been using it on damp skin immediately after getting out of the shower. It not only locks in moisture but it penetrates the skin and dries quickly and leaves no trace. I haven't messed up any clothes doing this. Additionally, this method works very well for my hair as well. When it's used on damp hair, the oil leaves hair shiny, soft and moisturized without any greasy residue. I want to try it on  my face because Miranda Kerr, The Duchess of Cambridge, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Victoria Beckham all swear by it as an overnight treatment. However, since I have oily skin, I'll have to try it on a small bit of skin and see how that goes.

This is very much like the others that I have tried. There are buttons that adjust the temp, turn it on and toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit. This brush says that it has ""ionic"" strength. I cannot verify this.

There are a few differences between this brush and the others I have tested in recent months. This one has the buttons on the back of the handle instead of on the side. One button turns on the ionic function, one button is the temp/on off control. This brush heats up very hot, up to 450 degrees, hot enough to sizzle your hair if you are not careful! The one thing I love about this brush vs the other brushes I have tried is that it does not have the odd little red balls on the ends of the brush tips. This brush has flat and smooth brush ""bristles"". (No give to them, they are rigid.) They snagged my hair much less.

I have frizzy hair and no matter what I try, ceramic, ionic, metal, etc.. My hair looks the same after each, so if there is some magic to the way ""ions"" work with my hair, I am not seeing it. I am not using a heat appliance to make my hair healthy.  If you notice a difference then this will please you because it has the technology to help your hair.

How does it work? It functions much the same way as a flat iron except this glides through the hair instead of along it. It takes the same amount of time to use this as a flat iron, I didn't notice that it saved any time at all over a flat iron. It still must be used on perfectly dry hair. (That means heat protectant spray needs to dry before using this. Steaming your hair is probably not a great idea, but do as you feel is needed, I am letting my hair dry first.)

It gets my hair smooth and sleek and is as easy to use as the flat iron. It is good for days where the humidity is going to bring out the frizz or when I want to go a day between washes but my hair has frizzed into a bozo look, even in a pony tail. This can tame the frizz in about half an hour if I am combing my hair flat, or in 4 minutes if I have my hair in a pony tail and am taming only that. This style of straightener brush snags less hair during use than the other models I have tested. That is a major bonus.

I am not sure what is easier to use or which one I prefer. I have both the flat iron and this brush sitting there. I alternate between them because I don't have a favorite.",1468195200,0,0,0,1,0

If you're giving this as a gift, it also looks the most beautiful upon opening compared to the other small square soaps.

I was truly delighted with the scent from soap once unwrapped.  As you can see from the attached photos, the bar is very large, a generous portion of soap that continues to smell good even after used.  The big bar has a citron perfume scent that I just adored with its yellow color. Really, really phenomenal scent.  When using the product I personally wanted the dreamy perfume smell to remain on my hands but no such luck.  As soon as the water hits the soap, the perfume smell dissipates leaving a fresh but mild soapy smell on your hands. Afterwards, your the shower, you won't have a run of the mill clean soap scent but it does offer a mild and subtle scent that is unique.  The soap itself is very good quality. It feels very moisturizing and takes a long time to wash off, which made me feel extra clean.

I bought similar soaps as souvenirs from my trip to Provence, France and paid a LOT more for them there. I wish I had known about these then and saved myself a lot of money and effort that could have been spent enjoying my vacation. I recommend that anyone taking a trip to the south of France order these instead for your friends and family and enjoy the beautiful scenery instead!

It's true that all their soaps really do fill your bathroom with the most divine scents.

This little jewelry organizer is perfect for the things I wear the most because it displays them, protects them, and keeps them clean.

It's a simple square acrylic box with dividers and a mirror on top. The top opens and closes freely, and there is no latch, so this wouldn't be good for travel.

used to be in curl reviving tonic. I am surprised and disappointed that they put it in. It is known to be toxic. I wrote the company and told
them my feelings about this. If many people would complain, they would probably take it out.
See the following for a commentary.

Phenoxyethanol is a glycol ether. Glycols are a series of chemicals that find their way into all sorts of things: paint, lacquer, jet fuel..... Phenoxyethanol is used as an anti-bacterial in cosmetics as well as a stabilizer in perfume.

The product's Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) says that it phenoxyethanol is harmful if swallowed, inhaled or absorbed through the skin and that it can cause reproductive damage. The MSDS refers to 100% concentrations, so is it safe at lower doses? In cosmetics the concentrations are typically 0.5% to 1%.

There are several animal studies that demonstrate that it is toxic - with effects on the brain and the nervous system - at moderate concentrations. In Japan, there is a concentration limit for its use in cosmetics. In Europe, the European Union classifies it as an irritant and there are various studies (on rabbit skin, for example) that demonstrate reactions at low doses. The EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) data sheets show chromosomal changes and genetic mutation effects in testing as well as testicular atrophy and interference with reproductivity in mice.

I also came across a report written by a medical professional who contracted allergies after coming into contact with phenoxyethanol in a detergent used for cleaning lab equipment. It seems he wasn't a fluke. There are over 3,000 known allergans and they were studied, along with the data from 9,948 patients, by a research team in Germany. Phenoxyethanol was in the top 10. An Italian study also determined that phenoxyethanol is a contact allergan. However, a 1990 article in the Journal of the American College of Toxicology said that it was only a mild irritant to rabbit skin at 2%.

Concern that phenoxyethanol is a neurotoxin precedes the FDA. German research in 1999, concluded that it had neurotoxin potential.

Phenoxyethanol breaks down to phenol and acetaldehyde, acetaldehyde converts to acetate. Phenol can disable the immune system's primary response mechanism. Given that, it is at best ironic, that phenoxyethanol is used as an anti-bacterial in vaccines. Acetaldehyde occurs during the breakdown of ethanol, (alchohol and 2-phenoxyETHANOL), it is a suspected carcinogen. Inhalation studies have shown irritation of the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract.",1433030400,1,0,0,0,0

The active ingredient is 0.07%  cetylpyridinium chloride, a quaternary ammonium cation antiseptic.  Research has shown that it has a small beneficial effect in treating gingivitis and preventing plaque and it is generally regarded as safe when used for short periods of time.  However, I do not think that using antibiotic agents on or in the body on a regular basis in the absence of an infection is a good practice because it interferes with normal, helpful bacteria and can cause health problems.  Oral microbiology in particular is complex and disturbing the natural balance of microorganisms could cause harmful species to proliferate.

I also prefer a stronger, more astringent mouthwash with fluoride.

I carried it with me every day and applied it liberally to my face, neck, ears and arms - anything that was exposed. Since it was quite hot and humid and I was perspiring a lot, I applied it again later in the day. I managed to avoid any sunburn at all, and since it is nearly unscented, it did not attract mosquitoes or other insects.

I'm so impressed with the sheer, non-greasy, unscented formula that I've started using it as my daily sun protection and will continue to do so throughout the summer. Previously, I would only use a high SPF lotion when I knew I was going to be outdoors for hours - mainly because I do not like the greasy texture and strong scent.

But first of all, this shaver will not cut longer hairs. The way it works is by using a  metal mesh with holes, just the exact size for your stubs to get in.  Longer hairs will not get into the holes because they will just lay flat on your skin as you sweep the shaver along.

So far as I can determine, the salient difference between this concoction and some other Crest varieties, not to mention Scope and Listerine, is the absence of alcohol, which I guess puts this solution in the category of antibiotic rather than antiseptic.

I have tried a few of the Crest Pro Health products. This version is alcohol free and is geared toward people 50 and older but has the same active ingredient as the Pro Health Invigorating Clean Invigorating Mint  alcohol based mouth rinse. It does not have fluoride.

I wish Crest would better explain how this is different from the products geared toward people under fifty.  For instance people of any age can have plaque, bad breath and inflamed gums. I think most of the Crest mouth rinses work against these issues so what makes this special for people over 50.

I did find this sentence on the back label of the bottle. ""This rinse was selected for people over 50 because it is alcohol-free and provides a unique sensation.""  I am not sure what ""a unique sensation"" has to do with being over fifty.  If that is the only reason it seems like other Crest Pro Health alcohol free products would work the same.

I like the taste of this product. It does not have the bitter alcohol flavor that  many alcohol flavored mouth rinses have. I don't notice a unique sensation.

I am troubled that the only reason Crest lists for this being for people over 50 is it has no alcohol and has a unique sensation. For this reason I gave this three stars.",1365897600,0,0,1,0,0

It's important not to go too light because the blush WILL look chalky or there will be no color payoff. So far these colors have been most flattering
1. Mata hari
Matte mauve pink. Gorgeous for everyday adds a natural looking flush to the cheeks. It is lighter than MAC slave to love blush which was one of my old favorites before I tried NARS!
2. Taos
Described as a dusty rose, but has coral tones on my skin tone. Has some shimmer but not very noticeable once applied to the skin. This one is very long lasting. Nice for brightening up your day...and your complexion!
3. Taj mahal
Looks very gold in the pan but adds such a pretty warmth to the cheeks that's a little shimmery and lit from within. There are many ravs about this blush on beauty blogs and YouTube and its true!
4. Desire
A scary bright bright bright pink in the pan but also very good quality giving cheeks the natural flush you crave for everyday. I've also seen this one on deeper skin tones and it still looks natural and flattering
5. Love joy
I was wondering if this would show up or just look like shimmer on my skin. After application it was a brownish berry color with slight shimmer and the blush I choose when I'm doing a strong smoky or colorful eye look. Looks very natural on my skin tone. Can't really be used to contour because it has the berry tone. The nars site describes this of a bronzed rose but on skin tones similar to mine would be berry toned.
6. Exhibit A
I've seen this on light medium and deep skin tones and it is widely flattering! Turns more red than orange on my skin but can look more orange on you depending on your undertones. Every woman should have this one in their arsenal. Some people believe this gives the most natural looking flush of all. It also photographs really well and looks good on video! Lol :)

Start your collection with any one of these if you're skin tone is similar to mine. NARS blush is one of the best blush brands out there I encourage you to try at least one even thought they have a higher price point. They are very pigmented and last a long time too!",1343952000,0,0,0,0,1

I am almost 30 years old, and still suffer from breakouts. I have seen dermatologist and tried a lot of things but they often dry out my skin too much, causing my skin to produce MORE sebum (oil) combining with the  medicines side effect of dry dead skin sells. This is a fast way to disaster skin-wise and often causes my skin to worsen. Because of this, I have tried many different facial cleansing devices, and here are the points that I like about this one.

1) Rechargable! Nothing is worse than needing to use a facial scrubber only to find that the batteries are dead. I cannot tell you how many times that the batteries have died (in other models) and then to make it worse, I often discover a mess of rust when I open up the compartment to change the batteries. The fact that this unit can be easily charged through a micro USB is not only convenient but also costs less and is safer.

2) Variety- all the different attachments that come with this unit is a nice little bonus. I can't genuinely say that I would use all of them (remember, trained in skin Haha) but as a consumer I still appreciate the additional options.

3) Quality- at this price point, it's surprisingly well made. I was a little concerned with the rubber cap that protects the USB port, but other than that, it's sturdy. The plastic does not flex at all, and it feels solid.

4) Sound- I never thought that something like sound would bother me, but I definitely noticed how quiet this unit is compared to other models I've owned. I have two small children, so I'd often have to go to a bathroom further away from their bedrooms to cleanse my face at night, but with the noise level of this cleaner, i'm just genuinely not concerned with waking them.

The only 'con' that I've found personally is the speed of rotation vs the softness of the bristles. I feel like it would be more productive to either have the head rotate faster or have harder bristles. Having said that, skin is very thin, especially when it's sensitive like mine. I DO prefer the softer bristles, because they are much kinder to my skin and I don't have to worry about causing more damage to inflamed areas. However, the brush's rotation was just too slow for me, (please see my review video for a short view of the rotation)  and I felt impatient at how long it took to get a thorough round of cleansing and sloughing to my face. Because of this, I cannot rate at 5 stars because it's just simply not as good as it could be. But, all things considered it's still a good sturdy competitor at its price point in today's market.

I did receive this product at a discount or free in exchange for an honest review. I strive to provide fellow consumers with the most detailed, unbiased and (hopefully) helpful reviews that I can, believing that allowing a discount to influence a review is a disservice to other shoppers. Therefore, anything contained in this review can be considered my own independent and unbiased thoughts and opinions, that have not been influenced in any way.",1463529600,0,0,0,0,1
7036,5,"07 10, 2016",A2XZM64TLWL34O,B01GQKM0AK,"Retinal has been proven to slow down the breakdown of collagen in skin and reduce dark spots. After using Retinol products for several months, I can say for certain it is producing noticeable improvement for my skin. The hyper-pigmentation between my eye brows has faded significantly and fine lines are smoothing out. This is a good quality anti-aging moisturizer containing the most Retinol (2.5%) I have seen in a skin care product without a prescription. From my personal experience, Retinol has been the best choice for my sun damaged skin since it has helped improve my discoloration and skin texture.

I like the fact that it is made with organic and natural ingredients which is something I look for in any facial skincare product. The ingredients included in this product such as organic Aloe Vera, Vitamin E, organic Jojoba oil and green tea are great for skincare, especially for the elasticity and collagen boosting. There are no added fragrances or colors to aggravate my sensitive skin and nose. I love the unique pump design as it protects active ingredients from sunlight and oxygen not to mention it makes for easy application. One pump will generate enough product for my face and neck. There is no more dipping unsanitary fingers into the jar to potentially contaminate the product. I appreciate the inclusion of an expiration date as well.

Due to the high amount of Retinol as indicated, I start out using this cream once a day in order not to dry out my skin, then gradually increase my application of it to twice a day. This moisturizer absorbs into the skin quick and well within minutes leaving a smooth surface which can be used as makeup primer. It does not leave a greasy feel or impact my foundation when applied. It is comfortable enough to be worn in warm weather without getting sticky or making me feel sweaty. This moisturizer makes my face feel well hydrated and nourished when I apply this cream at night after my toner and Vitamin C serum. I have sensitive skin, but this product does not cause any breakouts or negative reactions. It makes my skin feel much smoother and firmer than it ever has before. I have also noticed that some of my fine lines on my forehead are slowly diminishing. Overall, this is a wonderful moisturizer cream that has significantly improved my skin tone as well as texture and I would definitely recommend to others.",1468108800,0,0,0,0,1

6549,3,"05 27, 2012",A35W3JQYP0M655,B019809F9Y,"I recently started using an electric razor after years of being a supporter of the wet shave market.  Mostly for times when it's convenient and I am in a hurry.  I remember years ago when I used an electric shaver that this Williams lectric shave worked well in making a difference in a close shave.  Picking up a bottle after all these years proves that it still does, and in my opinion a pre shave lotion is a good investment for electric razor users.  That being said, I have to say that somewhere along the line Williams changed their formula somewhat, at least in the scent, for its not the same as I remember to be sure.  Years ago this pre shave smelled as nice as any after shave did.  It was a pleasant but not too strong barber shop sort of spice scent. Now it seems to have a very weak but not at all likable scent that despite its lack of strength still seems to linger on after you shave, even with a rinse.  It reminds me very much of those cheap after shave rip offs you can find in some dollar stores that go on smelling nice for a few minutes, but then quickly turn sour and cheap...  As good as this works at stimulating your beard with a splash of alcohol and other ingredients, my recommendation is to use Afta brand pre shave which I picked up at a local pharmacy, but is also readily available here on Amazon in a two pack at the time of this writing.  In fact I have ordered some here simply because Afta's availability locally is spotty at best.  Williams seems to have a marketing hold in my neck of the woods because its also easy to find.  But I still recommend this only if you don't have any Afta available.  Afta smells much better, works as well if not better than the Willians, and unlike the Williams, to my knowledge has always been the same formula....&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mennen-Afta-Pre-Electric-original-3-FL-OZ-PACK-OF-2/dp/B000Q71HY0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mennen Afta Pre-Electric original 3 FL OZ (PACK OF 2)</a>",1338076800,0,0,1,0,0

I got these body wraps because I didn't want to spend the RIDICULOUS prices that one company ItWORKS was charging for their wraps. These are exactly the same and an absolute steal at the price the company is asking.

The box comes with 8 wraps and envelopes with the mix and bandages. There is a little DIY to this whole process. You have to soak the bandages it comes with in boiling water for 10-15 minutes and stir the powder in the envelopes until it forms a paste. Once you have achieved the desired consistency  you paint the mix onto your skin where you are going to place the bandages. It is fairly simple. You leave it on for 45-60 minutes for maximum results. Then take a shower and wash off!

You have to reuse the bandages the box provides. You can machine wash them or hand wash them and hang dry to prevent shrinkage. I was able to use all the bandages and I am a fairly large girl. They covered my body just fine.

The wraps work well and provided a toned look to my physique. It is almost like wearing SPANX but without the SPANX! I did these wraps before I went out for the night in a little dress and I looked a few pounds lighter. The box lets you know to use these for six weeks straight and then once a month for maintenance. Overall, they are totally worth the price you are paying for the novelty and the fact that these DO work. 5/5 stars!

If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer! I received a discounted promotional sample of this item for my honest and unbiased review.",1446163200,0,0,0,0,1

With resin glue, it did mend a broken thumbnail, and made it strong enough to pluck guitar strings, which is why I bought it.

Carry it in your sundries (with glue, maybe in a little box or bag) in case of disaster. You'll need a small pair of scissors, too. If you have a nail disaster before a performance, this may save you.

You might also be able to make reinforced tips for your nails if you tend to break. I'm usually good unless it's winter or unless I'm doing household chores and forget ""GLOVES!"" Then my middle nail and my thumbnail tend to be the ones at risk for breakage.

Note: this is guitarist-talk so if you are scratching your head and wondering why someone is fussing over split nails, just trim the thing and move on, well, you need nails to play classical and it's a pain when they break.

This is basically a starter kit since it contains all the basics you need to get started including finger nail clippers, a small, metal emery file, 1 large and 2 small nail files, 2 cuticle sticks, manicure gloves and a basic travel pouch. The cuticle sticks are splinter free and have both beveled and pointy ends; the nail clippers are well made but not the sharpest I have ever used so I would recommend only using on fingernails, the files are thick and have coarse and fine surfaces; the gloves are soft and made of cotton but a little on the small side so would be better suited to smaller hands; the metal emery file has a plastic handle and a stainless steel file surface and my favorite item in the set and the travel bag is just a basic pouch that serves its purpose.  I would purchase this set mainly for travel or to give to my daughter but I would purchase a separate storage bag to keep or gift the set in.

Second the Manual or direction book that comes with this kit states clearly more than once it takes ON AVERAGE 4 ounces to be a full body treatment. Therefore 64 ounces divided by 4 equals only 16 treatments. So for me I have to use my own latex free wraps I bought else where. And I use my own nylon two piece rain suit because the so called free vinyl suit they supply is almost impossible to clean or keep clean and doubt if it launders through a washer. My inexpensive nylon pvc coated rain suit fits well and washes fine so it stays clean and I can move around as all elephants especially on the short side does not fit the free suit in this kit at all. Maybe it's left over from a comedy club special?
You ask if the stuff works? That's what you really want to know. That depends on you and your body and system. I use these cremes to combat over all edema build up caused by trauma to the lymph system. Primarily to help prevent and break up [fibrous & gel type pitting edema] fluids in both arms and legs. This brand works as well as most any of them for my purpose and needs.

I'll boost these treatments in a far-red-infra-red sauna set to 110 - 120 F. for 20-30 minutes too. Basically it does help but it's not a cure and I'm told there are no cures so I'm left to try to prevent it getting worse and treating it constantly with compression garments and treatments like these. It pays off over the cost of expensive Lymphedema massages and wrap sessions but you have to constantly work at it....no time off!

If this Vendor changes it's contradiction on coverage to 16 treatments and also informs people the wraps are not latex free I might have been more generous towards the kit. However since I have to use my own wraps and it's only half the treatment amount covered I suggest you look around for 1-2 of the 32 OZ jars which are easier to handle and avoid the kits themselves including this one.",1281744000,0,1,0,0,0

Dental floss is difficult and dentists split dental floss and even those plastic strips they use to help form materials on a tooth from getting on the teeth next to them...those will be demolished over and over before eventually they give up and turn to something else or manage to finally get a strip in between my teeth. Anyway at over 60 I'm  having some orthodontal work done and that does mean braces....first I've ever had with them...and my obession with flossing and my great gums I've worried sick about how to maintain that. Along comes these picks and on reviews alone and sight unseen I took a chance. They came today and they are perfect for my needs they are getting between some teeth that no floss could get between. The only bad thing about them is they are so thin it makes them potential sharp edge could cut a gum. I'm prepared to be careful and use them careful to avoid that. But they more than outweigh the dangers that may or may not lurk there. Also they seem to hold up. I can get through a full set of teeth without bending or breaking them usually. And the handly little dispenser is great for travel or handbag. If careful you might use one for several days. And you could probably sanitize them if you choose with mouth wash. Six packs means about six months supply. I'm happy with these..not so happy with the ordeal of braces. But this is going to make it much easier on my mind and stress level while going through it. I've tried some plastic like dental picks similar to tooth picks and tiny brush on one end but they are no where as thin as these.

50,4,"08 3, 2005",ABLOQZIL42W7I,B000067E30,"I am a dentist who recommends Crest White Strips because they do work to whiten teeth.  Follow the directions in the box, and here are some further tips:

1.  (Optional step)  I recommend you first brush your teeth with water (don't use toothpaste) to remove the layer of plaque.  Your enamel has pores and the pores need to be open for the chemical to penetrate. If you use a fluoridated toothpaste, the flouride may block the enamel pores.  (Crest's instructions indicate you do not need to brush. I talked to a Crest representative on this point, and she indicated that the hydrogen peroxide will penetrate plaque, therefore this step is optional.  The instructions indicate no brushing because they do not want fluoridated toothpaste on the teeth before whitening).

2.  Use the strips twice per day for maximum efectiveness.  The inner part of the strip has a chemical called carbamide peroxide (a 6% form of hydrogen peroxide; in-office dental whitening uses a 15-30% version of the same chemical) that causes the stains inside your teeth to be oxidized and turn white.  Applying the strips has a small learning curve as you will probably bend or fold a couple of them before you get the technique down.

2.  Leave the strips on for 30 minutes at a time.  After thirty minutes your saliva has probably diluted the peroxide to the extent that it is no longer effective.  You can reapply a new strip immediately if you chose, for the treatment requires one hour of treatment time per day to work.  It does not matter if you do this in one continuous 60-minute period or two 30-minute periods.  Do this for two weeks and your teeth should get whiter.

Disadvantages

1.  The chemical may ""burn"" your gums.  If you notice a burning sensation when you use the product, it is the peroxide oxidizing (or burning) your gums.  Depending on how severe the burning is, it may cause you to stop the treatment.  It is OK to stop the treatment for a day or two to let the gums heal.  Once they feel normal again, resume treatment with the White Strips.

2.  Your teeth may become senstiive during the two-week treatment time.  Try to push yourself through the sensitivity if it is mild, but if it bothersome to cold water or air, take a day or two off to let the teeth settle down and then pick up where you left off.

3.  The strips only cover your front teeth, so only your front teeth will bleach.  You may notice the distinct difference between the back (unbleached) teeth and the front (bleached) teeth.  Since most people notice the front 6 teeth anyway, this is not a concern.  However, if you have a wide toothy smile, you may want to have a dentist make you a tray that will hold the chemical on the back teeth to whiten them too.

3.  The bleaching effect works best on yellow stains.  If your stains are due to tetracycline (brownish grey stains in a band on your teeth, your best bet is to have a dentist whiten your teeth as the dentist will use a tray to hold a more concentrated form of the chemical on your teeth for a longer period of time.

Crest White Strips work for the vast majority of people.  Over time, you will get a result that should be whiter than when you started.  Crest White Strips are a good place to start with bleaching, and if you are not satisfied with the results, you can then see your dentist for a more concentrated form of bleaching or other cosmetic options.

I went from dry to oily to combination skin.  I've gone to the dermatologist, who put me on a regimen that has now made my skin the driest it's ever been.  I don't appreciate my skin peeling every afternoon, and I'm also tired of putting harsh chemicals on my skin.  I recently made to switch to all-natural makeup, and I've been looking for a brand to switch to all natural skin care.  Hence, I was excited when I got to try out the Living Nature line at a discount.

The first thing that attracted me to this product is the fact that it's made in New Zealand.  I had the pleasure of visiting N Zed a couple years ago, and it was refreshing to see the high standards that the country has on organics the lack of pesticides, hormones and additives seen in meat, and how much fresher and better everything there smelled and tasted.  Having been there, I automatically trust the products produced there more than I would anywhere else.

As far as this anti-aging emollient face cream goes, I've been using it everyday, in conjunction with the rest of the line of Living Nature products, and I am very happy with the results.  The cream goes on smoothly, absorbs completely, is not too thick or too thin, it does not make me break out, and leaves me skin feeling soft.  Also, my skin is no longer peeling every afternoon, and not only is it a lot clearer/more even in tone, but it's also a lot firmer and youthful looking.  I can now see that the chemical products I was using were making my skin worse, not better.

I also have to mention that I really love the natural smell that the products in this line have.  It reminds of hiking through Karangahake Gorge and all the plant life you could smell whilst walking next to the raging river: damp, tropical, fresh, exotic.

It looks like I've found the brand to finally make the switch to all natural face products.  Highly recommend!",1467676800,0,0,0,0,1

5514,3,"06 22, 2016",A3TWPW6C78JPGV,B00O4KVVCI,"The headbands I received are NOT like the ones in the product image.  The product images (and some reviews) show 6 different colors, and a cotton-like fabric, but what I received was 4 different colors (2 grey, 2 brown, 1 navy, 1 black) made from shiny spandex swimsuit fabric. To make matters worse, none of them are stitched nicely, and I can see the glue that has oozed out under every HBY logo label.

I've attached some photos showing the hole on the underside of each band.  I understand that sometimes a hole is left in order to sew the seam and flip the whole thing inside out at the end, but in this case, ALL the stitching around ALL the holes on ALL 6 bands is loose and unraveling.  So there are literal and figurative loose ends here.

The headbands are comfortably roomy, so they make good hair accessories for washing your face and pushing your hair back.  But the lackluster workmanship, the cheap-feeling spandex fabric, and the fact that I didn't receive the diversity of colors that were advertised mean that I really can't give this more than 3 stars.

What fascinated me the most was I went swimming in a chlorinated pool the next day without my swim cap.  Even after being exposed to that water, this heavy cream was still in my hair. I had to shampoo three times to get it out and get my regular hair back.

[Postscript: I hardly expected the above to be controversial.  (Hope it wasn't something I said.)  Practically everything in the review is reportage of ""personal experience,"" which no reader is qualified to ""refute.""

But I happen to like Colgate Total, and my last 3 check-ups have been complete successes--no extra dental work required.  The only ""claim"" that may be inviting some controversy is the very final clause.  Would it be acceptable if I changed it to: ""On those nights when I don't brush my teeth, rinsing with this product is ""better than nothing""?  (I'd be happy to change to that wording. But I could say the same thing about rinsing with plain water.  Moreover, a claim that weak certainly would not justify a 5-star rating.

6087,4,"09 22, 2015",A1MF83RMFXN6TF,B00YB5YZME,"I was offered this product for free. The following is my unbiased review after testing it carefully.

This is a rechargeable unit that can be used without the cord. I find that a bonus as these units eat batteries. On a full charge, this lasted for forty minutes during testing before I noticed a decrease in power. Pack the cord if you travel with it. I did not test standby time.

The callus remover does it's job well. Be sure to apply only gentle pressure, this is sanding off skin. If you use it against healthy skin, you could cause a mild abrasion. I always rinse the sanding wheel after use and allow it to drip dry after blotting off the water. This removes the skin flakes. Obviously, do not use this if you have an infection of any type on your feet or have any problem that causes numbness in your feet. This will slow down if you press too hard, but use your brain, gentle pressure and short sessions. Putting on socks after you slather on lotion can help keep the calluses at bay long term after using this.

The shaver head is perfect for either trimming or shaving. Not quite baby smooth, but very close. It took as much time as a manual razor but no risk of slicing myself. (Real danger for me, I usually press too firmly with the regular razor and have shaved off narrow patches of skin.)

The epilator is a small head. The petite size makes it ideal for small patches, not so great for legs. It is appropriate for under arms, forearms, etc.. The feeling is more intense than waxing. Waxing is a long strip, this is a tiny swath at a time, a few hairs at a time. If you have a low pain tolerance, skip using this head and use the trimmer instead. I like the smoothness left behind, but disliked the time it took. Waxing takes fifteen minutes for both legs. This took twenty minutes for one. The pulling feeling as hair is yanked takes getting used to at first. Try a small spot first on the leg that is less sensitive. Stay on the side or back of your leg at first as this is a less sensitive spot than the fronts of the leg.

Do use common sense, this is not to be used in the tub or near water.

The directions are easily understood and the callus remover + is packaged neatly in an attractive package designed for retail.",1442880000,0,0,0,1,0

The 1090x is Philips/Norelco's flagship razor and this one is more of a middle of the road competitively priced product so any comparison is unfair...for the 1090x. For the last month, I've alternated between this razor and the 1090x, and my impression is without reservation, the 8040x delivers a superior cut. I've finally found a cordless that eliminates the need to keep some manual razors in reserve. Whomever led this product development team is making the top tier team look bad.

Notwithstanding bells and whistles, the primary function of any razor is to offer a smooth, comfortable shave and this rechargeable gets the job done with aplomb, with or without utilization of the moisturizing system, whether employed as a wet or dry shaver. I'm not a real big fan of products that obligate additional expenditures for consumables like the Nivea Conditioner but I realize it is a nice feature for those who may need the conditioner to avoid skin irritation. I would recommend Nivea and Norelco team up to produce a fragrance free version as this product does conflict with other scents the consumer might use.  It is not my practice to use the conditioner every time I shave (every other day) but at my present rate, I would anticipate the initial conditioner supply will last at least six months.

Cleaning the shaver is a snap. Just turn it on and wash the heads under hot running water. I wish the upscale model cleaned as efficiently, but then, as I facetiously stated in another review my primary use for that pricey unit is as a display item now.

This razor's tracking system follows facial contours (head in my case) quite efficiently and does not require anywhere near as much pressure to achieve a close cut on stubble as has been my experience with the top of the line model. Additionally, the relatively compact size and shape is easier to manipulate. The 8040x also has a detachable trim head that can be used for close grooming and you can actually see what you're doing, another advantage over the premium model. Just pull off the tracker head and lightly press on the trimmer attachment.

Charge time for a full charge is about four hours for 40 minutes of shave time. There is a 9 minute quick charge capability that provides enough power for a three minute shave. The charging stand has a reasonably small footprint although for convenience and my take on durability, the charging cord has to be unplugged but remain attached to the base. The inexpensive plastic retainer does not look as though it would withstand multiple rotations.  The travel locking feature is a nice touch but the travel case is a joke.

Yet, for nearly $150 less than the top of the line model and superior shaving capability, I'll figure out how to securely pack it.",1216080000,0,0,0,0,1

After washing your face you apply the scrub and massage gently for about a minute. It immediately felt pleasantly warm when I put it on. The vitamin C crystals didn't feel too harsh at all and most of them were melted down after I was done scrubbing. After that you apply a small amount of the activator and massage it for two more minutes. It melts the crystals completely and turns the scrub into a serum consistency, it felt slimy to the touch. Then you rinse it off; I like to do it in the shower and I can even extend it down to my neck if I want. My skin felt so amazing and smooth afterwards and definitely not over scrubbed in any way. I'm a big fan of this kit!

The important ingredients are: Aloe Vera, vitamin C, vitamin A, Manuka Honey, Shea Butter, Coconut Oil and Cehami. Anything with Manuka Honey as an ingredient, has my full attention (to say it's miraculous is an understatement). The moisturizer absorbs well, leaving no residue of any kind; it's fragrance free.

Here, the description was not kidding when it noted that these dried lavender blossoms provide a ""subtle"" scent. It's so subtle, I basically have to put my nose within inches of it to smell anything at all.  I've always enjoyed the scent of lavender, and with a busy household I had hoped to use this as a potpourri to improve various mystery smells that can occur in a home with two kids. Unfortunately, it didn't work the way I had hoped.  While the dried blossoms are amusing to play with, as dried herbs often are, they are not exactly pretty compared to flower petal potpourri. It's also sad that the bag is not designed to be resealed. If you're careful you may be able to use the original sticky seal, but you have to be very careful opening and closing the bag. For all of these reasons, but especially the lack of smell, I'm afraid this is one Pre de Provence product I am not able to recommend.",1505952000,0,0,1,0,0

That does come to be the case with the Gilette Fusion Proglide Manual Razor. I like it because it gives a strong clean cut shave right out of the gate when you use it. My biggest gripe though is that only after a few times because the blades in the cartridge are so thin, the razor does become quickly dull to the edge. So even to the visible eye, you lose that shave and you'd have to earn those wings by quickly getting a refill for your Gilette razor. While it is a great concept, it can be a easier waste of money only after a short time. Hopefully, Gilette can come out with a razor that can be closer to the edge.

I've been using the Gillette Fusion for a couple years now and really like it, so I didn't think I would have to get used to anything new there. I was wrong. I couldn't shave nearly as fast as I'm used to because it's awkward to hold the trimmer and try to shave without cutting yourself.  After a couple weeks I got a little more used to it and was able to speed things up, but still nowhere as efficiently as using my standalone razor.  The worst part about this product though, is cleaning it.  It clogs all the time, and I am not even a hairy person, but I was constantly cleaning it to get hair out from between the blade and the back of the trimmer.

This is suitable for all ethnicities.  I have been a faithful user of this mask for 3 months.  My skincare routine is very stringent, but I do not have to wear any foundation at all, just lipstick and eyeliner.  Try using this mask powder mixed with rose water to help soften skin.  Other liquids such as green tea, milk, and mineral water will give the skin additional benefits as well.  I use it daily to keep acne away, and it does have a mild lightening effect (which is natural) so over time you will see any hyperpigmentation begin to fade.  My skin is not as oily as it used to be.  Just use less than a teaspoon of the powder mixed with the liquid of your choice, or even plain water, to make a thin paste, or less water to make a thicker mask and apply it to your face and neck.  Leave it on for 15 minutes or until you see that it has dried.  You will notice that your skin feels like it is getting tighter as the mask dries.  Rinse it off with warm water and pat it dry.  If you mix the mask powder with sandalwood, it will also help with discoloration. You may want to use a moisturizer after your mask.  There is no need to wash your face with soap afterward as this will over dry your skin, use your facial scrub weekly when using this mask.

I opened that bag up and found:

1. The nail kit
2. The nail clippers
3. The toe spacers

Arbitrary as it may seem, my favorite part about the clippers is that they have a smiley face design cut into the metal. So cheery!
The toe spacers are not the foamy kind you normally think of for using when painting your nails. They are the type that go fully around each toe, and actually give your toe muscles a nice stretch. Our feet get crammed into weird shapes all day in our shoes, especially if the shoes have maybe a narrow or pointy shape, or if you have one toe that is a little extra long and it gets smashed every day... So it's good to put spacers like these on while you're relaxing to give your feet a good stretch and some relief, help them to get to where they should be more naturally.

Finally, the nail care tool. The packaging was plastic, but easy to open! Not the kind that you have to use scissors and then you get cut on the thick plastic. No, I actually pulled it open with my bare hands. (Im strong like that.. just kidding..) So the tool... It has a cap at the bottom for inserting and removing batteries. It's nice that the batteries actually came with this item! There are three inserts for the tool, and make sure they are packaged in the correct order in your package.

Step One: Use the dark blue, coarse grit to file the edge of your nails
Step Two: Use the light blue insert to buff the surface of your nail, the entire flat part of your nail
Step Three: Use the white insert to shine up the entire surface of your nail!

There are products out there that are a multi-sided tool, this is basically the same only it adds power to that. So you can just hold it to your nail and move a little bit, instead of moving vigorously with the other tools.

As with any new tool, there is a learning curve to getting the most out of it. With this one, I think the vibration is so strong that you need to learn the right amount of pressure to use. If you apply too much pressure, it will stop moving. So you need to learn how to use it and in that way and precision is a little challenging due to the strong vibration. I wish the other attachments could be stored somehow in the body of this tool rather than being loose. I know they gave you a big plastic bag you could store it in, but it would be even more convenient if it was built in. Like those pencils that have a bunch of tips inside and when one goes flat you shove it up the bottom of the pencil and a new tip comes out... Okay, so not exactly like that, but just the idea of being stored within would be great!

I've never tried another product similar to this that I can compare this to, but overall I like it. A couple areas I mentioned above that I suggest for improvement or tips for use, but at the end of the day, it definitely has the ability to perform its task, shaping and shining your nails which is great if you're not that into nail polish, but you still want to have a nice and healthy shine.

4678,4,"03 17, 2015",AW7BIYHXUIZ62,B006MRPMMG,"Head and Shoulders is well established as effective in successfully combating dandruff, but I had gave up on using it years ago -- driven away by the harsh unpleasant scent.  This new Head and Shoulders Green Apple scented dandruff shampoo is an improvement.

As always, the active dandruff fighting ingredient is pyrithione zinc, effective and an approved over-the-counter antifungal/antibacterial agent.

As a shampoo product, I found this product to deliver rich, thick lather, rinses clean, and smells great.  The green apple fragrance, by the way, is not sharp or bold, but muted, reasonably pleasant, and you'll not likely notice it unless you intentionallt take a sniff.  I also chose to use a separate (different branded) post-shampoo conditioner.  Afterwards, I was very pleased with my hair - soft and manageable as one expects with a quality shampoo and conditioning.

I don't currently have a dandruff problem, so being a fan of moderation in all things chemical or medicinal, I'll mix in use of this Head and Shoulders for about every other shampooing, or to get the recommended treatment about twice a week.",1426550400,0,0,0,1,0

There is a soft side and a rougher bamboo side that you can wash and exfoliate your body with. There is also a small loop that you can use to hang the mitt up with to dry and store.

The issue I have with this mitt is the design does not make for ease of use. Once you put a bar of soap in it, it becomes very bulky to use in the shower or tub. A better design would have been to have a strap across the mitt so you can slide your hand in. It would've made it much easier to hold.

Beyond the design issue is the real problem - the quality. If you look at the pictures you can see the velcro is not properly sewn onto the mitt. Also the edges that are sewn are not straight,even or complete. There are frayed edges which means this mitt will not last long at all.

For one thing, the shaving conditioner is highly effective in providing a lubricated surface so the Norelco head glides on your face. The conditioner has a nice musky scent and is similar to most men's aftershaves. I have used the Nivea conditioner and 8040X on a daily basis for about a week without ANY skin irritation, in-grown hairs, or other skin issues.

This is my first electric razor and I have only used wet bladed razors in the past. 3-4 blades you name it, I tried them all (Mach 3, Mach 3 turbo, Sensor, Schick Quattro) and after the first 2-3 days the blades get dull and my skin gets extremely irritated. To top it off, I have to shave after I shower or else the hairs are too stiff to cut. The Nivea conditioner works well enough that I can just use my 8040x in the morning before I shower and not run into any cutting issues.

Pros: The injection system is pump-action so there are no CFCs or propellants that contribute to ""global warming"", it is very easy to use and is very hygienic especially because of the precise metering system on the Norelco 8040x system.

Cons: Cost. Logistics-wise, the Nivea is going to be more expensive than shaving foams or gels but they rarely provide the same lubricating qualities as the Nivea.

Bottom line: If you enjoy using the 8020x, 8040x, or 8060x, the Nivea is an excellent choice for the wet shaving system.",1214784000,0,0,0,0,1

6207,4,"11 16, 2015",A16AXQ11SZA8SQ,B012KPK5PW,"I've been losing weight (so far, 30 pounds, and 60 more to go).  Needless to say, this has left my flabby body even flabbier, with looser skin.  I was excited with offered this Detox Body Wrap at a discount in exchange for an unbiased review.  It's fairly easy (though messy) to use.

* Boil some water, remove from heat, add the wraps (basically extra wide ace bandages) and allow to set for 10-15 minutes;
* After the water/wraps have cooled for 10-15 minutes, mix the clay powder with warm water and apply to the desired area;
* Remove wraps from water, wring until no longer dripping;
* When you burn yourself from wring the wraps, place them in a spagetti strainer to cool further, then wring the rest of the water out;
* Wrap the bandages around the desired area (I did my tummy), and secure with the included clips;
* When the clips break, go get some safety pins (which I should have got before I started all this), and use them to secure the wraps.
* Put a warm damp towel over the wraps (or do as I did and use neoprene wraps, which are better at holding in heat);
* Wait at least an hour before removing everything;
* Then clean up the mess you made, and measure yourself.

As you can see, there were a few kinks.  I needed to let the wraps cool longer before trying to use them, and the clips ALL bent to the point I was unable to use them.  That said, I noticed a definite improvement in my skin tone.  I've attached Before/After pictures (using a ""cutout"" artistic effect -- lets face it, nobody wants to see a fat, old tummy in Amazon's pictures).  You can see that I still have a lot of work to do, but the after picture showed definite improvement.  While I received this at a deep discount for review purposes, I plan on buying more of this product at full price to keep toning and tightening my skin as I lose more weight.  If I meet my goal weight, I will post picture of the final result.  I expect that will be mid-2016.",1447632000,0,0,0,1,0

These wraps do not have any smell to it. I thought I would have to wash of some sticky residue but there was none at all. I applied this right before bed and slept with it on for 8 hours. When I woke up the wrap was still perfectly in place. Removing was just as easy as applying. It peels off smoothly and painlessly. I didn't get to measure myself since I don't have a tape measure but I was able to see a pretty significant change. tummy was a little firmer and a little flatter. 2 days later I repeated and got even better results.

The products tried were (in order of preference): Williams Lectric Shave, Electric Glide Formula (California North), Afta Pre-electric by Mennen (original), Skin Bracer, Eltron Prep and Kinexium Shave Oil by King-Of-Shaves.

I have used an electric shaver for more than 30 years and, for the first time in over 20 years, am trying these pre-electric lotions again after having shaved without these the last 20 years. In general, these all provide a noticeably smoother and less irritating shaving experience. They don't speed up the process, but do allow for a close shave while minimizing the shaver `burn' sensation that follows shaving. The trick is to find the one that you prefer based upon application, performance and odor.

Bottom line: Despite the superior application and lower `oily' feel of Afta, I had to go with Williams Lectric Shave. It is easy to wash off (if you wish) and has a mild and pleasant odor. Electric Glide Formula is a very close second and I alternate between the two, but use Williams Lectric Shave much more often. Williams Lectric Shave has the least amount of 'gumming' in the blades vs. the Electric Glide Formula (which can be heavy).

The gel consistency of Afta is much better for application than the liquids (which run through your fingers, like water), but only Afta is a gel. It's surprising: you'd think they would all be scrambling to offer the superior gel consistency or, at least, put the liquids it into a spray pump. If you put the Williams Lectric Shave and Electric Glide Formula into sample-sized spray pumps, spray them on your face then spread with your hand, you will have a much better and less wasteful experience.

Application (applying it to your face):

Using a spray pump for the water consistency products is a must. Without a spray pump, application is difficult and wastes product (as it runs off your hand)

- Afta has a gel consistency that makes application easy and can sting.
- Electric Glide Formula has a water consistency and no sting when applied.
- Williams Lectric Shave has a water consistency and can sting.
- Skin Bracer has a water consistency and can sting.
- Eltron Prep has a water consistency and can sting.
- Kinexium Shave Oil is like spraying WD-40 onto your face: VERY oily and is no longer a candidate.

Shaving:

They are ranked in order of preference. Most of the products cause `gumming' of the beard trimmings in the shaver blades. This will require more frequent cleaning of the shaver than shaving without them.

- Afta has less of an `oily' feel to it that is easy to wash off. There is no 'gumming' (clumping of the beard trimmings in the blades).
- Williams Lectric Shave has a moderate `oily' feel that is somewhat easy to wash off. There is very little 'gumming'.
- Electric Glide Formula has a moderate `oily' feel that is easy to wash off. Heavier 'gumming' vs. the above two.
- Skin Bracer has a moderate `oily' feel that is difficult to wash off and can cause `gumming'.
- Eltron Prep has a moderate `oily' feel that is difficult to wash off and can cause `gumming'.

Scent following sink washing of the face:

These will all stay with you for many hours, so you better like what you pick (ranked in order of preference).

- Williams Lectric Shave has an `evergreen' odor.
- Electric Glide Formula has a mild citrus odor
- Skin Bracer has a moderate lime odor
- Afta has a strong musty `woodsy' odor.
- Eltron Prep has a `skunk' type of odor",1260748800,0,0,0,0,1

I have been using it for several months, and Im lazy so I cant say I used it every night but when I did manage to give my skin a spa ending I would always run this along my top lashes and through my brows. Interestingly enough I found that this made my lashes grow longer, I could really see the difference when applying mascara ( LOreal Telescopic ) and they would be much longer than usually, especially in the center of my eye, it also helped with some broken ones I had on my right eye towards the outer edge from a cheap curler, which chopped them off. That happened to me more than once, and it took months to grow them back, before it took so long I stopped hoping but this serum seemed to make that time a lot shorter and made me realize how different parts of my lash line are vulnerable from makeup tools.

It stings a little if you let it get into your eye through careless application, so go easy but so far Im really enjoying it, and it feels natural, not chemical, when its on my skin its almost like water and feels fresh. I believe apple has been used in this, to stimulate the growth and its made in the USA.  This might not work on everyone, since nothing ever does but I had great results, count me as a happy camper  :)

I won't allow her to use it herself, because she is only 9 and I worry she will burn herself.  This is the perfect solution for her and for me.

The straightener itself is designed like a regular hairbrush, however, the bristles that are on it and super hard.  They don't flex like a normal hairbrushes bristles do.  I think that is where the success factor comes in with this.  I was surprised at how easy this is to use.  You simply plug it in, turn it to the temperature you need/want and start brushing your hair.  Easy Peezy!  From the time that I plugged it in to the time it was ready to go was literally just a couple minutes.  The temperature does read in Celsius,  I used it at the highest temperature and it worked great on my granddaughters hair.

My sleep schedule has caused me to get some serious under eye dark circles. I was worried about how it was affecting my appearance. Even with piling on concealer in the morning, I still feel like my severe dark circles are visible. I was so excited to try out this eye gel in hopes that it could help me!

I have always had dark circles, and after using this eye cream for a few days, they have been going away! My dark circles have been much worse this past year, so I was worried that I wouldn't be able to find a product effective enough to help. I wish I could get more sleep or have a more consistent sleep schedule. But that's impossible, so I need something like this eye cream to reduce the appearance of dark circles! This saves me so much time in the morning, since I don't have to worry about putting a ton of concealer on.

After applying this product, my eyes do feel moisturized but not greasy. The product absorbs very quickly into my skin. I really dislike when creams make me feel greasy, especially around my eye area, but I don't have to worry about that with this gel! It is very quick and easy to use every night!

This product has many ingredients which are good for your skin, which makes it an insane value because you only need this cream for your eyes. You don't have to worry about applying so many different products, when this is all you need! The components of this eye cream are known for their anti aging and skin brightening benefits!

I never really had acne in highschool but when I got college aged, I began breaking out on my face, chest and back. I went to a prominent dermatologist and this is one of the things he recommended I use. I'm in my 40's now and until recently I used this soap every day in the shower. I hadn't had any real break outs for years and years.

A bar of this soap generally lasted me a couple of months and I'd stocked up with several bars so hadn't bought any for approximately six months. When I ran out and went to buy more, I noticed the box was different but didn't think too much of it. Within a few days of using the soap in the new box, I knew something was very wrong. My face felt hot and itchy. It looked almost sunburned and the texture was sort of rough, like nothing I'd ever had before. I still happened to have one of the boxes of the old version of the soap and noticed the formulation was a 5% salicylic acid. I compared it to the new box and noted it's now made with a 5% benzoyl peroxide solution!

I called the company and was told that they had bought the Steiffel lab company in the fall of 2009 and would no longer be making the salicylic acid version of the soap.

I did some research and found that Clinique makes a similar .5% salicylic acid version so I bought two bars of it. I don't like it quite as much as my old standby but it's still very good and my face is back to normal. Unfortunately, it costs almost twice as much per bar but it's still less expensive than many other treatments out there, it's simple to use and it works so I feel it's a worthy investment.

I also found that Aveeno has a bar using salicylic acid called ""Clear Complexion Cleansing Bar"". It was very inexpensive and I noticed it's available in lots of different stores where I live. I bought a bar of it but haven't tried it yet. I'll try to remember to review it as soon as I have used it for a couple of weeks or so.

My advice: SKIP this new formulation of Panoxyl bar soap! It's harsh, smelly, and doesn't control breakouts. Honestly, this benzoyl peroxide version is the absolute worst thing I've ever used on my face. I didn't even want to leave the house for a few days after using this only about 3 times.",1277769600,1,0,0,0,0

Two small drawbacks are its small size and plastic bottle.,1367366400,0,0,0,0,1

I couldn't believe the great way this product REALLY works!  The difference between this and regular hair treatments is distinct and unique. It is wonderful!
I gave Marvel 10 Effects the real litmus test: I shampooed my hair with a fairly nondescript, somewhat drying shampoo, Then I used no conditioner, and towel dried my hair. I followed the directions and sprayed Marvel 10 Effects directly on my damp hair. Then I used a brush (!!!). It went through beautifully, as if I had all sorts of detangling, conditioning products in my hair. Then I blew my hair dry, a bit more roughly than usual, to see what would happen. I did cool the dryer down at the end to seal my hair. However it was a vigorous drying session!
I then looked at my hair and could not believe the difference in the glossiness, the texture, the appearance of volume, and the fullness. With no frizzy ends, and even an appearance of shape and volume, as if I had used hair spray ( but without any of the tacky texture you get with hair spray)!  This is an awesome product.

On the bottle, it says that the ten benefits you get from Marvel 10 Effects are:
1) Replenishes lost moisture in dry, damaged hair (<--it did)
2) Prevents static (<--it does ... and I have been known to be the ""queen of static""!)
3) Protection from heated styling tools (<--that is why I blew my hair dry using high heat, and although I do not recommend doing that, Marvel 10 came through for me as stated. I did it as a test, and it passed it completely)
4) Effective detangler (<--Yes! As I said! )
5) Rich in antioxidants (<--what are antioxidants? They keep your hair healthy...Healthy is how my hair feels, now!)
6) Aids in brushing to help reduce breakages (<--from the time my hair has been treated with this product, every time I have brushed it since, it looks great)
7) Maintains hair styles for longer (<--Yes indeed! It is amazing!)
8) Reduces the appearance of split ends (I have short hair, but I would expect, from the way my hair feels, that this would be the case)
9) Controls frizzy, unruly hair and adds shine (YES IT DOES!)
10) Suitable for all hair types (well, my hair is not in great shape normally, and Marvel 10 Effects has fixed that, so if  that counts as a vote for suitable for all hair types, so be it!)

In conclusion, I am amazed at this fantastic treatment! I do not know how to tell you how very much better my hair is since I began using this, but I will say that if you really do have concerns about taking good care of your hair, THIS PRODUCT,  Simply Beautiful Marvel 10 Effects 10 in 1 Hair Treatment, really does what it claims to do.
My hair has never looked better. I love this product! Because of it, I feel great about my pretty, shiny, silky and thick looking hair!

Thanks!

3637,4,"02 2, 2014",A2OL5WLCNZVD9K,B0014AX89K,"I bought a one-ounce stick at my local health food store, for two bucks. Because I have allergies, it is important to try products without huge financial investment, so this seems reasonable.

Right now I am using it on my (now happy) lips, rather than the commercial products that have additives with long chemical names. I plan to also use it on the place where my computer stool has made unpleasant calluses as well as on my elbows that rest on the desk until I think to stop that behavior.

The cocoa butter is most pleasant and the cocoa smell is there but not very strong - quite acceptable. It does seem to be a particularly effective emollient and is quite without any of the additives that experts are advising us to stay away from. (Think ""dimethicone"", a silicon polymer that makes products more spreadable but unfortunately forms an impenetrable barrier that, while it may prevent moisture loss, also traps bacteria, etc. and prevents normal transpiration and absorption of necessary medications you apply later, is an allergen for some plus is not biodegradable and these days is found in a huge majority of skin products. Whew. Isn't it disgusting that manufacturers DON'T CARE?)

This cocoa butter stick comes packaged in a plastic tube with a manual push-up feature that means that with each use, if you want to recap it, you must push it back down. So far so good - the cap itself pushes it down without creating a mess, at least at 55F. But it doesn't bode well for this coming summer. Also there was no protective packaging which means that nothing would prevent another customer from trying it out, contributing a virus that might or might not survive on that medium, and putting it back on the shelf.",1391299200,0,0,0,1,0

5481,5,"04 24, 2015",A6P370Q9YB27F,B00NT0AR7E,"The market is filled with ant-aging products and even though we have many too choose from, some rarely work. Like I have mentioned in past reviews, no oversight like in the supplement world, so most products just have to not hurt you and they are really overlooked and still being sold. I spent the last few weeks testing out serums to devices that help with aging skin. It's so hard knowing I invested a few weeks and a product just did not deliver what was stated.

Thankfully, Oz Naturals was not one of them!

I love retinol and especially one that did not cost an office visit. Yes, the prescriptions are not as costly as one would think but the office visits cost money and refills require another office visit. It gets up there and I honestly do not feel I am need of the prescription strength, yet. I prefer to not over medicate my face because if I up the potency, I also up the side effects and with Summer around, I also up my chances of getting a red and peely face. I'm all for anti-aging but shedding skin like a lizard is not sexy no matter the bikini you wear!

Oz Naturals has a 2.5% retinol serum, which contains Astaxanthin and Vitamin E. The formula is a strong orange hue in color that always makes me think the retinol oxidized, as yellow is the first tinge you see when it does, followed by the orange color that comes after. Thankfully, this is just a coloring from the ingredients versus a serum going wonky and I prefer getting pass the color versus a dye being added to just calm my fears. That is what Oz Naturals does, it offers a natural approach to your skincare's needs.

Ingredients (as listed on website): Organic Herbal Infusion, Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf (Aloe), Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide (botanical hyaluronic acid), HamamelisVirginiana (Witch Hazel), Pentylene Glycol, Phospholipids, Retinol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carrageenan Gum, Organic SimmondsiaChinensis (Jojoba Oil), TriticumVulgare (Wheat Germ Oil), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Organic Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea), WildcraftedResinaPropoli (Propolis), Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin.

Astaxanthin: This was an ingredient that I had heard of but was not familiar with, as not any of my beauty products contain it. It's a carotenoid and an antioxidant. It's what they feed salmon when people for some reason want to see a pinker/orange hue in their fish. It does not convert to retionol (Vitamin A), however research which is still limited, has reflected it may aid with inflammation, oxidation and even UV damage. I like that it's simple and as long as it's derived naturally and not in it's synthetic form, it has the potential to help and protect against oxidative (free-radical) aging skin.

Verdict:
I love serums because my skin loves them. They absorb quickly and that means less residue and you don't feel that heaviness that some creams tend to leave behind. Most serums play well with cosmetics and because I have increased my retinol use to both day and night use, just making sure I use sunscreen in the day to avoid redness or hyper-pigmentation issues. The latter part would kind of go against what I am trying to do (save my skin), so please don't skip on your SPF. I used the serum for a total of 3 weeks and like always, I am going from one 2.5% retinol brand to another. I will notice if a product works if it does or does not maintain the progress I have previously achieved, and I can then measure if the new serum brings anything new to the party. Even though Oz Naturals is orange in color, it did not leave a orange colored goop that was hard to hide. My skin absorbed the serum with no problems! I did notice that my skin at week two had a nicer and more pleasant texture. My skin had a glow that the previous retinol serum did not add. It was not an oily glow but just a healthy one and because I suffer from horrible seasonal allergies, this is something that unfortunately always reflects on my face and sadly my skin. The glow I got sort of helped make me look healthier and less tired, so it took attention away from the signs of having bad allergies gives you. I'll take it! Any serum that can do more than just deliver retinol is what I seek. I'm always looking to simplify my routine and I literally went from Oz Naturals 2.5% retinol serum to then moisturizer at night, and done! Just switch to an SPF moisturizer in the day and it's the easiest and most effective duo I have found, so no excuses that you have no time for your skin. With Oz Naturals, you will only need 3 minutes to get what I consider a good anti-aging beauty regimen, so you can even do it while brushing your teeth :)

5016,5,"12 22, 2012",AQIJ3ZEEVCIKU,B00C6NZH3E,"I've had so many razors over the years with these gimmicky cleaning systems that seemingly work great at first, but always crash and burn over time; sometimes, not even a very long time before they bite it.  We had the first Braun to feature a cleaning system when it just came out, and that thing was a dud.  Shaved ok, but the cleaning system was a joke and broke within a couple months.  We replaced it, and then that one broke too.  Then we got the Braun Pulsonic -- slightly better shave, slightly better cleaning system -- it broke after about a year.  And finally, we tried the Panasonic Arc 5.  Seemed to be the best razor by a mile, which was good considering the VERY steep price.  But then, after a couple weeks, the cleaning system started it fail; it never turned itself off and would go literally for hours on end if we didn't babysit it.  Complete junk.

Enter Phillips Norelco

I'd used their original 3 head shaver many many moons ago, then was lost to Braun and Panasonic for years, before I finally found my way back here.  I have to say, in the years since my absence form this product, they've really upped the anti.  This is without question, the best razor I've ever owned!  The 3D technology is no joke -- it really does make a difference in shave quality.  Each head floats independently across my face for a near flawless shave, each and every time.  Unlike my other shavers that caused razor burn, I don't have to press this Norelco hard to my face.  It just gently glides across my face, easily mowing down all the whiskers in its path.  Best shave ever by far.  Fast and easy too.

Excellent Cleaning Base

It's like putting your razor into a little Jacuzzi bath all its own.  The motorized mechanics precisely lower the razor into its little bath, and then get it all shiny and squeaky clean. It does a great job and looks really cool and cutting edge too.  Oh, and best of all, it's QUIET!!!  My Braun's always sounded like a Learjet was taking off in my bathroom!  No joke!  But this Norelco is smooth as silk; quiet, effective, and economical to operate.  Unlike Braun, that was overly expensive for their cleaning solution, this Norelco is very affordable at barely four bucks a bottle.  Better still, it's more readily available locally than the Braun solution ever was.  And the Norelco seems to last a good while, so I won't be spending as much and can clean my razor more often since it's economical.

***Helpful Tip*** - Definitely get the frustration free packaging!  The retail packaging on this one is definitely a HUGE pain in the you-know-what to get open!!!

Bottom Line -- Hands down the best shaver I've ever owned.  Hands down the best cleaning system ever.  And most importantly:  hands down, my best shave ever!  Amazon has the best price on this by far.  Almost 100 less than my local Target.",1356134400,0,0,0,0,1

I am 53, and these firm and tighten. Hydrogel really absorbs into the skin, much better than sheet masks and far greater than just serum with no mask over it. These are unlike any others I have tried because they are sticky (rather than slimy or wet) and adhere to the skin.  They are in two pieces - you first put on the top half which covers the top half of your face (with eye slits).  Then you put on the bottom half and pull the ear pieces over the ears tight. The bottom half is also sticky.  As such, you can walk around or sit at the computer and don't have to worry about the mask falling off.  I use this is the morning before work so that my skin looks toned and hydrated. Maybe you need to be a little older (like I am) to appreciate the toning and tightening effect. These are not cheap, but most hydrogels are at least this price. Overall, this is my second purchase of these and I will buy them again.

6086,4,"10 6, 2015",AT53ZTTO707MB,B00YB5YZME,"This combo callus remover/epilator/shaver has several things going for it:  I love that it is lighted, and that the light is nice and bright and angled properly so that I can see tiny hairs and see what I'm doing.  It has a great ergonomic grip and it feels good in the hand.  Best of all, it is rechargeable and that means that it is more powerful than similar hand-helds that use AA batteries.  It charges over night and gets one through over 30 minutes of use without starting to squeal in defeat.

That being said:  The three different heads are smaller than other similar hand-helds that I own......The roller head on the callus remover is not wide enough and the roller is also a smaller diameter (means that the roller revolves faster per second; but that does not mean it works better or more efficiently).  There is only one roller head for the callus remover, and it has a fine-grade grit.  Fine-grade is adequate for touch-up work, but if one does not buff their feet often, fine-grade grit is not enough to remove tough calluses.  A half-hour working time for the battery will not remove tough calluses.  You will need to recharge and give it another go the next day, and the next day, and the next.....Of course, one can leave the appliance plugged into the adapter and a wall outlet.  In that case, you can continue on, but it will take you a long time to wear down a tough, thick callus with this fine-grade grit roller.  The kit should really contain a coarse-grade grit roller, in addition.

New roller heads are NOT available for sale at this time, although the seller assures me that they are soon to be added.  Also, the heads on this appliance have a bit of a bough, or curve, on one side, so they are not interchangeable with other makes and models.

The epilator works decently.  Like I already said the head is narrower than most, so it does take at least quadruple the time to remove hair from one leg, as opposed to shaving. It removes most hairs, but misses a lot of fine hairs.

The razor works okay, but it does not cut real close to the skin.  It does leave a slight stubble.

Thinking through all the pros and cons, I would like to say that my four-star rating is a low one--maybe 3.5, if Amazon offered it.

I often use these types of scrubs on my body and hands at the sink. We live in a very dry and hot climate while taking care of a lot of people and animals and I have found oil based scrubs to be a good way to clean, exfoliate, yet moisturize our hands as well as a great way to moisturize after swimming. The product worked fine.. I just personally was a little put off by the smell and colors.

It offers so many benefits.  Currently I am using a coconut infused shampoo and conditioner that has worked wonders and I wanted to add a coconut deep conditioner / mask to round out my hair care routine.

I have processed hair and it is damaged from a bad color job so I experience a lot of breakage.  The ends are weak and my hair is filled with split ends.  I can't afford deep conditioning treatments at the salon on top of getting my hair done, so an at home, do it myself treatment is perfect.

The container is a very generous size, 8 ounces.  Using this product once or twice a week I would imagine it would last a minimum of 3 months or more.  I opened the container and took of the seal and was immediately overjoyed and the yummy coconut smell.  The directions state to apply to hair after shampooing and leave on for 5 to 20 minutes.  I applied this mask in the shower after I shampooed my hair so I was only able to leave it on for about 5 minutes.  I rinsed it thoroughly.  When I dried my hair I was happy to discover that my hair wasn't greasy and the product didn't leave any residue.  Some masks can leave hair feeling greasy like it needs to be washed again.  The product itself is lightweight, like a normal conditioner.  It's not a heavy ""mask"".

Typically after I blow my hair dry, the ends are very frazzled, my split ends show and my hair just looks gross.  You can see in the video that my hair looks healthier and hydrated, definitely more nourished.

I am very excited to see what kind of results I will have after I use it a few more times.  This is a great alternative to expensive treatments.

My husband has been using this stand for two weeks. He said it feels like a quality product. Perfecto stand is described as chrome but based on the weight my husband thought it felt like it was made from stainless steel (this is a good thing).  He felt the brush holding side was perfect. The razor holder gives a somewhat less secure hold, it wobbles a little bit due to shape of the handle on the razor.  This is a minor quibble and overall he likes the stand.

This stand is provided by PerfectoTM.

It is a thicker cream, better used for cold temperatures and dry environments, but is not good for a hot day and humidity. I recommend blotting after a few minutes, as there is a slightly oily sheen to the product once absorbed, but blotting and applying a matte foundation immediately remedies the issue. A little goes a very long way, use sparingly. For a lighter option, try Boots No. 7 Moisture Quench Day Fluid. Works like a charm.",1314403200,0,0,0,0,1

Great Spring and Summer color, easy to apply and seems to be wearing well!

I am a nude, peach, beige, pale pink nail polish wearer so when I had the chance to try this bright purple color I hesitated at first and then thought, why not! Well, why not, indeed!!! First, it is not as bright as this picture shows. The bottle I received is more of a deep lavender which suits me just fine as I love anything lavender/purple.

I had not used essie before trying this nail polish and it went on smoothly. I put a base coat on first, then 2 coats of essie, then a top coat. I wear a lot of amethyst, tanzanite and blue topaz jewelry and I must say this color of polish just screams Spring/Summer and wow, what it does for pastel gemstone rings is unbelievable :)

I wash my hands a lot during the day due to cooking, cleaning around the house, grooming and playing with our cats, etc., and so far I have noticed no chipping or peeling from all the soap and water and I just can't get into wearing gloves when I do the dishes/pans and that's one reason I rarely wear nail polish these days because I just can't be bothered to be re-doing it every couple of days so it looks good. I have the feeling I just might be surprised with essie and can wear it longer. That would be great!",1458604800,0,0,0,1,0

I have been using this interesting serum for a while now and I'm impressed. Packaged in an air and light safe bottle with a pump dispenser this serum has a rich, golden-orange colour that lightly tints but doesn't stain the skin. The tint fades after a little while, so don't be alarmed if you are a little goldenrod coloured after application. Essential Smooth has a prominent herbal-sharp scent but it isn't too strong and it doesn't linger long, once applied. If you are sensitive, be aware that there are essential oils in this formula, including lavender and Neroli.

My favorite way to use this serum is to mix it with facial oil, press it into my skin hairline to bustline and work the excess into my hands and go to sleep and wake to soft, smoother looking skin and fresher, more youthful looking hands. This is a lovely product and I recommend it.

The Panasonic ES8109S 3-blade - barely. Put the Remington blades and cutter (keeping the center blade of the Panasonic) on a Panasonic 13,000 RPM shaver and you would have the World's best electric shaver. The Remington shaved a little closer than the Panasonic and provided a faster shave. However, the difficulty in cleaning, noise and lack of a charging base tipped me to the Panasonic as the final choice.

This is a review of three Panasonic models; ES8243A (4-blade), ES8109S (3-blade) and ES7109, the Remington MS2-390, the Norelco 8260 CC and the Braun Series 5 8995 (8985 & 8975 only differ in displays and cleaning). I have an average beard and have been using electric shavers (foils and rotaries) over 30 years. The models here are no better than any of the other higher quality shavers I've owned. It takes about 10 minutes (no shaver will give you a first-pass close shave) to get to that good dry shave (with or without pre-electric gels/oils) and you do have to put pressure on to get a close shave. This means recharging every 4-5 days. Gels/oils do make the process easier - not faster - and I have reviewed six of them on their Amazon sites.

ES8109S: This 3-blade shaver gives a very close shave, with some work. It does give off a higher pitch `whine', while shaving, that is somewhat annoying, but is not what I would consider noisy. Nor is the cleaning operation noisy. Based upon other reviewers, I was expecting it to sound like a lawn mower, but it is just an occasional buzzing noise as it cleans. The ""Arc Foil"" design slows shaving (see discussion, below).

ES8243A: I had hoped that the four blades of the Panasonic ES8243A just might be able to give a superior shave. As it turns out, the large four-blade surface is like trying to keep the end of a 2x4 on your face. It makes cutting in the areas where you don't have a lot of skin area (chin, jaw line, upper lip, base of sideburns, etc) more difficult. In fact, I think that the fourth blade in the middle actually interferes with a better shave and these two middle blades are not as good as the primary cutters. The ""Arc Foil"" design makes it even slower (see discussion, below). Another future problem with the 4-blade system is that you'll want to buy a new shaver when your blades and foil need to be replaced. What kind of an idiot is going to spend 80% of the cost of a new shaver just to get a set of new cutter blades and foil? All in all: the ES8243A 4-blade is a poor value.

ES7109S: The flat design of the foil is a better design than the ""Arc Foil"" (see below). Unfortunately, this shaver has an under-powered motor and the floating head that cannot be locked.

Panasonic discussion: Panasonic had developed an outstanding shaver line some ten years ago. My old ES8067 still shaves closer than this new ""NANO Technology""- a misnomer (marketing gimmick). I think the reason is that Panasonic's older models came with cutting blades with the individual blades having been about half the width of all of Panasonic's newer cutting blades (including replacements). This means more surface area on the newer blades and that means less cutting. Remington has the ideal blades (that Panasonic used to make) and it shows in closer cutting and less time spent doing so. Additionally, these new Panasonic ""Arc Foil"" shavers have the foil curving AWAY from your face at the ends of the foil, further decreasing exposure to the blades and requiring many more passes to cover the same area. Unfortunately, Panasonic puts their better motor (13,000 RPMs) only on these ill-conceived ""Arc Foil"" designs. Battery time on the Panasonics is the shortest of all shavers reviewed here. The Panasonic trimmers are so narrow, on all of these models, that you will not be able to trim sideburns with one attempt. You will have to re-position the trimmer to get what you missed. This increases the probability that you will get an uneven sideburn.

The Remington MS2-390 has the blades that the Panasonics should have (and did have years ago): flat foil area (not ""Arc Foiled""), good length (25% longer) and ultra thin cutting blades. As a result, closeness of the shave is better and time spent is shorter. This is, however, the loudest (and it is loud) of all shavers and there are no bells and whistles. Using a pre-shave oil/gel will gum up the blades, as with any shaver, but these blades pop off with even the slightest brushing so be prepared to watch them fall into the sink with every cleaning attempt. A charging stand would greatly increase the convenience of this shaver. Remington did a poor job with the details.

The Braun Series 5 8995 tries hard (you can hear noticeable slowing when necessary pressure is applied, like a lawn mower when it reaches thicker grass), but it doesn't get quite as close as the Panasonics or Remington without leaving a stronger burning sensation after the shave. The Braun can also leave burn marks and even cuts (nose and lips) that will bleed. Odd: you would think that, with it getting so close as to actually burn the skin, it would also give a closer shave. I suppose this is proof that shavers cannot ""lift"" hairs to cut better. Additionally, the design of the handle is inferior, making positioning more difficult. It does have a much wider trimmer and longer battery life between charges, though.

The Norelco 8260 CC: I used this rotary-type of shaver for many years during the 80's. I switched to foil and found I could get a closer shave. This is still the case. Additionally, because of the circular blades, it is somewhat difficult to target certain spots for cleanup. However, this is the quietest shaver.

PS: don't accept the nonsense about giving your face 30 days to adjust, unless you are coming off a blade. If you are accustomed to an electric shaver, you only need a week or two to determine the difference. The only thing magical about 30 days is that you can no longer return it for a refund - what a coincidence!",1260748800,0,0,0,1,0

I wandered in, captivated by Bee Yummy's minimalistic ingredient listing: honey, honey cappings, bee pollen, st. johns wort oil, royal jelly, water, and balsam needles.

After trying a sample---- amazed by the non-sticky residual, super quick absorption, and raw, organic goodness--- i snapped up a whole selection of Live Live products: Bee Yummy, the Honey Face Mask (very pricey), and the Love Butter (100% pure coconut oil). Out of all 3 products, the Bee Yummy and Love Butter are the best.

Bee Yummy quickly sinks into skin like a serum. It is best for oily skins or young skins who don't need extra hydration. Unfortunately, it doesn't do much to truly hydrate as it has the texture of a very light water-based, ""teen-ish"" moisturizer. It will NOT keep you moisturized in the dead of winter--you'll still need something more occlusive. But no doubt it's good for your skin --so, i use it as a underserum before applying my heavy duty moisturizer and after my vitamin C potions as a ""middle layer"".

If you are looking for a basic, oil-free type of hydrator, why use one laden with chemicals when you can use this? If you are looking for anti-aging superpowers, forget it. This won't help, but it won't hurt. I have not had any miraculous ""magic"" healing with this product and don't expect it to. It is not a magic potion.

First of all, I hate it when you get a cream polish and it takes three or four coats in order to get it to look opaque. There was so much pigmentation in this nail polish that I could have gotten by with just one coat, although I put on two. The photograph shows the two coats on my hand.
After doing one hand, the polish started to thicken up a little on my second hand. I've noticed that this often happens with quick dry formulas. No problem, I just wait a minute and then reshake the bottle.
If you don't do that, it can come out thick, which makes it a little streaky or textured. Even if that's the case, all of those imperfections disappear when you apply this magical top coat. No, I'm not exaggerating. It really is Magic.
It evens the color and gives you a perfect shine that lasts for days and days.

And here is the part that I want to shout out... If all of the above weren't enough to make you really love this stuff, hold on because there's more.
I have long complained that I don't like the Essie nail polish brushes. They're great if you have small and short nails, in my opinion, but not for me.
The brush has a perfect curve that matches the base of your nail, and it's wider so that with three strokes, middle side, and side, you are DONE. The brush holds just the right amount of polish.

It looks great when you're wearing blue, pink, and even certain shades of burgundy. It's absolutely stunning with tropical prints that include flowers and greenery.

After doing that, it warmed up quickly and stayed warm for many hours later. I know that when I checked 6 hours later, they were still warm.

I also found that I could use these similar to a hot water bottle. If one of my kids was cold or was feeling sick, I would just give him one of these hand warmers. He would then put it up against his body in bed and he seemed to really like that extra comfort.

1731,5,"12 9, 2007",AJ4F2BWA11DBP,B000UK2VRK,"I recently ""upgraded"" from the 8020X to the 8040X. Since the razor and shave are the same, I chose the 8040X for the following reasons:
- Shorter Charge Time: the 8040X fully charges in 4 hours versus 8 hours for the 8020X, and the 8040X indicates when fully charged.
- Longer Shaving Time: the 8040X fully charged shaves for 40 minutes, the 8020X for 30 minutes.
- Quick Charge: when the battery is depleted, the 8040X can be charged for 9 minutes to give you 3 minutes of shaving time.
- Travel Lock: the 8040X has it, the 8020X doesn't.
- Pop on Trimmer: the 8040X has it, the 8020X doesn't.
I figured with all these additional features, the 8040X was worth the additional money. But I was even more fortunate. I had a 20% savings certificate from the local Bed, Bath and Beyond, and bought the 8040X at the same price I would have paid for the 8020X elsewhere, so I found a great deal.
Both of these shavers give an excellent shave. For me, just as close as a blade without irritation (Yes, it is just as close for me. I can't speak for other beard/skin types, but if you don't have a brillo pad for a beard, it does a GREAT job). And unlike any blade I've used over nearly 30 years of shaving, these razors do not irritate my skin at all! I've used it everyday and even on 2-day growth, and it works fantastic.
Suggestion for you all: instead of using the conditioner, which is expensive and has to be dispensed often when shaving, try using Nivea for Men shaving gel that you can buy in your local grocery store. I use this exclusively and it works great, and will be much, much cheaper over the long haul. Also, I always shave in the shower, as I've found I get the smoothest, most comfortable shave that way. However, I have shaved over the sink on two occasions, and that works well too if that's your choice.
In closing, let me say that shaving with this Norelco is the first time ever I've enjoyed shaving with any razor, and I've used Braun and Panasonic too over the years. Enjoy your shaving now with this one!",1197158400,0,0,0,0,1

The one issue I had was that the skin on my neck got irritated from time to time but it was never anything major that wouldn't go away after a few hours.

6285,5,"02 13, 2016",AYABRBZUMRLXQ,B014DH4FTC,"This True Glow Eye Cream glides over my skin smoothly and absorbs quickly leaving my eyes refreshed and hydrated.  It doesn't leave behind any unwanted greasy or sticky residue and wears all day under my makeup.  The plant stem cells visibly improve the appearance of fine lines while the strong antioxidants neutralize free radical damage that is encountered daily and prompts collagen production.  This protects the delicate under eye area and improves your skin texture.  The Arnica works to stimulate white blood cell activity, relieving trapped fluid and bruising, thus leaving your eyes refreshed and brightened.  The naturally derived Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, which is a unique type of Vitamin C that's known as one of the most effective and deeply penetrating antioxidants, gives this eye cream an extra boost by improving skin circulation.  This leaves your under eye area looking well-rested for that bright-eyed look we all desire.  Since the skin around our eyes is thinner and more fragile than the rest of the facial area, it needs deep hydration to remain soft and toned.  The ingredients organic rosehip oil, botanical hyaluronic acid and their proprietary silk protein amino acid blend are nature's most powerful sources for this needed hydration.  This True Glow Eye Cream contains a balanced formula for both day and night usage.

I recently reviewed another eye cream where I talked about other uses to make it a multi-tasking product.  Therefore, for the purpose of this review entry, I want to address a few dos and don'ts when it comes to applying your eye cream.  That's why I'm going to share an article that was published by Into The Gloss in 2014.

Tapping, dabbing, massaging. Everyone applies eye cream a little differently, like we're each a special, puffiness-hating snowflake. But should you actually be putting the stuff on all willy nilly, or is there an objectively superior application method? The truth is...slightly complicated. It's less that there's a single correct strategy, and more that there are lid hydration best practices. This isn't just something we thought up on our own (although our inner lives are vast!)dermatologists agree. ""I don't think there is any one right way,"" one doctor admits. ""Basically, you should be gentle."" But what does gentle even mean? Gentle like 'pretend your face is an antique silk wedding dress once owned by Princess Grace of Monaco', or gentle like 'just don't give yourself contact dermatitis'? To clear up what, exactly, anything related to eye cream is about, he has a few useful pointers:

DO TAP AND/OR MASSAGE
""Soft massage and patting are both great,"" the doctor advises. You can press the cream in, you can try light, sweeping strokes, or you can even put it on a cotton round and leave it on under your eyes for a couple of minutes.

DON'T PULL AT YOUR SKIN
""You don't want any stretching,"" he says. ""The skin under the eye is a different structure from the rest of the face; it's more delicate."" So if you're really moving your skin around when you rub cream in, you're probably doing it too hard.

DO LET IT SINK IN
Give your eye cream about a minute (or longer, if possible) to absorb before you put makeup on top of it. That way, your powder or concealer won't cake up from the extra emollient base in the eye cream.

DON'T PUT ON TOO MUCH
If you pack on the product, it won't make it more effective. It will, however, creep into your eyes and irritate them. Just put a pea-sized dab on your ring finger, then dot it on your brow bone and about a half inch underneath your eye. That's all!

Granted, the information above is probably not new to most people, yet I found it necessary to share anyhow.  The reason why it's important is because the area around our eyes is extremely delicate and should in essence be treated with kid gloves.  I don't know how many times I've seen people apply eye cream like they would body butter (vigorously).  Every time I witness this, I cringe a little inside and step in like they've committed a skin care felony.  I'm very passionate about proper skin care because no matter what, we're stuck with the skin we were born with and we need to do what we can to keep it as healthy as we can for as long as we can.

That being said, I absolutely love this eye cream.  Honestly, I love all the Valentia products I have had the pleasure of trying and using.  They have an exceptional skin care line that I recommend for all skin types.  I have been using their products for almost a year and have not experienced any adverse reactions.  Not to mention when I use this under my concealer and foundation, it doesn't make my makeup look cakey in the least.  You really can't ask for much more in a skin care product.

Konjac is actually a plant root with natural antioxidant ingredients that help fight hard to reach acne causing bacteria. You basically wet the sponge and massage face in circular motions; no need for any sort of face wash.  When the sponge first arrived it was rock hard, so I was a tad skeptical!  But once you've gotten it wet, it's very soft and smooth against your skin.  I have VERY sensitive skin and this didn't bother me a bit.

Zum Oil - use for massage or I used all over after I got out of the shower before bed. It is oil but I didn't feel greasy. I like it better than baby oil that I've used sometimes in the past.

Zum Mist - Use this on yourself or spray your bed linens with it. So relaxing. The scent is somewhat subtle - that's not to say you can hardly smell it. It smells strong enough but not so strong that it's overwhelming like some mists I've used.

Zum Wash - I thought it lathered well and it didn't strip my skin.

Zum Body - It's lotion and you get 2 plump pillow packages of it. There's enough in each pack to do your hands, feet, elbows and knees. Love it!

Zum Bar - you get two fairly good sized bars. I imagine they'll last at least a few months depending on how often you use them. I really like this soap. I wash my hands a lot and this soap doesn't feel like it'll make my hands too dry and you can't feel a coating when you rinse. It feels like your hands are clean but they have a lovely scent to them that lasts for awhile. Note that right after washing my hands I was eating some cherries and though I could smell the scent a little, I couldn't taste it at all so even though it does scent your hands a bit, it's not so much that you'll end up transferring the scent/taste to food you might handle after. Just make sure you rinse well.

Zum Rub - I thought the scent of this was a little less than the other products but the balm really softened the heels of my feet. I use it along with a pair of heel socks and I wake up in the morning with soft heels and no cracks. Plus it comes in this adorable little tin that you could re-use after the Zum rub is gone.

This soap has a definite target market.  It says right on the package that market is men. Young men. Specifically men who desire to ignite irresistible attraction.  I had some apprehension about being alone with myself in the shower using it!

The product itself is not what you would usually expect. Take the box for example. It is plain glossy black.  No pictures of sheep grazing in Irish meadows, no fields of flowers or raging rivers.  Nope, just a plain black box with the word Zest imprinted in small letters on the end flap.

When you open the box a sensually rounded bar of soap slides out. It screams at you in shades of brilliant red/orange/tangerine unlike any bar of soap youve ever seen.  At that moment you know the Force is with you and you have unleased pure raw irresistible attraction, for you see this soap is PHEROMONE ENHANCED, containing that stuff that is supposed to make other people lust for your body.  I was curious about that so I checked with the makers of Zest to find out what the magic was all about.  I didn't want to misinterpret their intent so here word-for-word is how Zest defines their key ingredient:  Zest High Intensity Force contains Androstadienone, which is reported to significantly affect the mood of heterosexual women and homosexual men, Androstadienone does not alter behavior overtly, although it may have more subtle effects on attention. Androstadienone is commonly sold in male fragrances; it is purported, to increase sexual attraction.

Whew!

If you're able to stay with us here for another minute, here is what else is in each bar:  Glycerin, Aloe Leaf Extract or Mallow Extract, Vitamin E, Cocoa Butter, Sea Salt, Shea Butter, Almond Oil, and Polyquaternium-7.  So, you see, overall this is pretty good soap, no harsh or harmful ecosystem-killing chemicals or stuff that will make your skin shrivel up and make you less resistible to any and every girl (or guy) who smells you when you walk into the bar.

So how does it really smell?  Im going to borrow a line from Kevin OLeary on Shark Tank to describe how I think it smells  it smells like dog poo.  Now Im REALLY afraid to find out what Im going to attract when I step out of the shower.

How do you rate something like this other than to say your results may vary.  I happen to like it (which could turn into I love it depending on who ends up finding me irresistible attractive) but for now lets stick with a solid 4-stars.",1452470400,0,0,0,1,0

To be clear, my review is only for their six inch shower mirror. Out of almost 300 user posts only two here are for this mirror, neither is very positive.

I don't have a very good opinion either. For twenty bucks I expected something like you would find in an upscale bath specialty shop. But no, this thing is what you would find in a dollar store and that's all it's worth. Twenty US bucks is ridiculously too much for this mirror.

The suction cup is not heavy-duty as they promise. I expected one of those strong suction cups with a lever lock like they use to mount a cell phone holder to a windshield. But no, it is just a basic dollar store suction cup. It sticks ok when used on a very glossy surface, like a bathroom mirror (but since this mirror doesn't magnify I don't see why I would stick it to my bathroom mirror). It doesn't stick well to my shower where it would seem to be more useful and that is its biggest drawback ... the mirror appears to be glass, and with a weak suction cup there is a high possibility of the mirror falling and shattering in the tub/shower. I cant believe they can market this thing without a cautionary safety warning.  They could have avoided that concern if they had clearly stated that it is either breakable or shatterproof  they stated neither.

Finally, the huge garish tacky logo right on the front rim. I have no desire to give them free advertising forever by putting this in my bath. They obviously didn't get the memo that these days respectable companies no longer plaster logos on the face of their products. My new smartphone doesnt have one, neither does my new 4k TV, even my new sports car only has one very tiny logo almost hidden in the back. My advice to them is to drop the self-worth trip next time.",1504310400,0,0,1,0,0
8187,4,"01 15, 2016",A331BHAR0TRLWT,B00SG733XK,"I love mascara and try as many brands as I can. I was actually sent a full sized tube of this Wet n Wild Mascara in a subscription beauty box from Walmart or Target or somewhere. I didn't bother to open it for a while because I am used to using Tarte, Lancome, and sometimes Maybelline and CoverGirl. Wet n Wild was never one I even really tried except a time or two.

The other day I saw the package and decided to try it. I have thin straight lashes and like drama. I don't like natural looking lashes, I want LONG, dramatic ones. As this says it is a volumnizing mascara, I expected it to maybe give me some volume and I would use a second mascara for length.

The tube is big and the opening is a bit TOO bit which allows a lot of mascara on the wand. I scrape the brush against the sides as I pull it out to avoid getting too much mascara on the brush and my lashes. To my surprise, rather than giving me volume, I got length and a lot of it. I got a bit of volume but nothing major . But the length! I got not clumps and no spidery looking lashes. The mascara didn't flake or smear and it lasted until I removed it.

Since that day, I have been using Lash Out Loud MaxVolume Plus sometimes with a primer, sometimes with another mascara that gives me more volume but it's fine alone too. I get enough volume so that I don't look freakish with long skinny lashes and I get separation. My lashes wing out on the outside corners, something that ""Cat Eye"" mascara never did for me. I am quite happy with this inexpensive mascara. Shocked but happy. If I got a tad more volume, this would be AHHHHmazing. But as it is, if you like length, no clumps, and spending a few bucks rather than double digits for mascara, this is one to try. I will buy it another tube when I run out of the one I have.",1452816000,0,0,0,1,0

This mouthwash claims to help with inflammation and soreness of the gums. I'd say this claim is true. I wear braces and do get inflamed/sore gums from time to time. Crest Pro-Health For Life has helped with that. It actually soothes the gums. The inflammation goes away much quicker.

I used this in my WaterPik with great results as well. Normally, I fill it up half way with warm water and the rest of the way with Listerine. My orthodontist recommended this on account of the gaps I get from my braces, to clean good and disinfect the loose gum area and to help the irritation/inflammation. I feel like this Pro-Health does a better job in that area - it feels like it is soothing the sore spots and like I said, the inflammation, soreness and redness goes away much faster.

I did ask my orthodontist about using this mouthwash, if it would be beneficial to me in regards to the gum issues, since this product is meant for people over 50 years of age - I am only 36. He said it definitely could not hurt to try and would probably work well since it is made for gum issues. He told me to let him know how it goes. When I told him I believed it worked better and helped more, he told me to continue to use it. When he looked in my mouth in order to determine the adjustments for my braces during that visit, he mentioned to me that 2 particular areas look better than usual. The gum line at two specific teeth was always more red than any other area, even though it was never actually painful or swollen. Since I started using the Pro-Health, that redness has gone away.

To me, this product is very beneficial, while being gentle. There is no harsh alchohol taste, no nasty after taste. It is just simply a smooth mint flavor, just like the bottle says, that makes your mouth taste and feel fresh. In my case, it definitely did help with gum problems and for that reason I will continue to use it regularly.",1368576000,0,0,0,0,1

I've also switched only to sulfate and paraben free shampoos and conditioners.  the last step was to switch to a gentle microfiber towel and cut down my drying time.  So when I saw this towel being offered for a discount to test and review, I jumped at the chance to order it.  The fineness of microfiber is only one tenth that of real silk. The warp knitting microfiber cloth, which is made by high-quality looms, has a surface of soft, cohesive and even down. Therefore, this kind of cloth has strong decontamination and water absorption ability. It will not bring any harm to the surface it wiped, neither will it have any cilia falling off. Whats more, it is durable and easy to wash. As soon as it is put on the market, microfiber cloth has won great reputation, especially microfiber bath clothing and microfiber hair drying towel. Lets see what advantages make microfiber towel so popular, compared with traditional cotton towel.

Microfiber cloth, which adapts the technology of orange shaping, will increase the surface of the microfiber and the pores in the fiber. In addition, it has many capillary cores to improve its water absorption ability. For this reason, absorbing water and drying itself promptly has become a marked characteristic of microfiber towel. No wonder why microfiber bath clothing and microfiber hair drying towel win the heart of their costumers.

The coloring process of microfiber towel adopts high technology like TF-215. So, microfiber towel has strong migrating and retarding dyeing ability. This advantage of microfiber make us free from the trouble brings by decoloring pollution when we are cleaning.

The polyster filament fabric of microfiber is almost unbreakable. Meanwhile, since warp knitting technology is adopted, there will be no running or shedding. Cleaning towel made of microfiber is perfect for the cleaning of glasses, screens, instruments, painting and electroplating surfaces.

When we use traditional towels, especially natural fiber towel, the dust, grease and dirt of the surface we clean will be directly absorbed into the inside of the fiber and remains there. Therefore, our traditional towel will lose its elasticity and feel hard after long-term use. While, microfiber towel absorbs the dust between the fibers, instead of keeping it inside the fiber, the fiber number and the density of fiber is high. In this way, microfiber towel is easy to clean.

When I received this product, I was hoping to see 100% rosewater only instead, it had different ingredients which are still safe to use on the skin but since I'm a regular rose water fan and use the 100%  percent Morrocan Rose Water ingredient which is Rosa Damascena, I was hesitant to try it because of all the other ingredients it contained.

I sprayed some on a cotton pad and pat it on my face and was able to lift some makeup residue and not break out or have any skin irritations. The scent is very beautiful and not too strong and I actually spritzed some on my hair for some fly always.
But I have to say the Elrique Naturals does the same thing at toning and hydrating and refreshing the skin like my other rose water bottles.

5025,3,"07 18, 2013",AMB2Z4FMDBWQY,B00CDKTE48,"This is the first time I've received a bundled dental kit. It's like ""The Best of Crest Pro-Health"". I'm not sure who would buy such a kit (is it a birthday gift for someone who really loves their teeth? Or for a student going off to college? Or is it a CARE package for a loved one in the Armed Forces? Maybe). The only reason I see an ordinary consumer buying it is for purely economic reasons - if it's actually cheaper to buy this set rather than buying each individual item (which is what most people do). As of this date, Amazon has no price for the bundle, so I can't compare (I will update this review when the price appears once again).

The kit consists of the following:

Crest Pro-Health Healthy Fresh Toothpaste
Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Refreshing Clean Mint Mouthwash
Crest Pro-Health All-in-One Medium Toothbrush
Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Deep Clean Floss

First, the all-in-one medium toothbrush is decent but since I use Sonicare, it is of limited use to me. Since I have receding gums, I have given up using manual toothbrushes. However, for the everyday user (hubby) it works fine. Nothing special.

The second item that particularly interested me was the mouthwash. As some of you know, there has been controversy over Listerine because long-term use of any mouthwash containing alchohol is reputedly linked to oral cancer. Hence, I was interested to see if this Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection Alcohol Free, Clean Mint mouthwash was a viable alterative.

It has a minty taste and leaves a mild, tingly feeling (definitely not as strong as Listerine). However, I understand from reading some reviews on this product that it contains a stain-causing chemical. Since I used it only few times, I can't judge whether this effect is true. So far my teeth look fine and I don't see any excessive brown stains. I can't speak for whether the mouthwash is any better than Listerine, though. Since alcohol does kill germs, I am suspicious that it may not be as effective for long term use as Listerine. As a compromise, I plan to alternate this mouthwash with Listerine.

Next. Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Deep Clean Floss. I love Glide. No problems here, and I love the fact that it doesn't shred as easily as other brands do. The best part of this set for me.

Lastly, the toothpaste. According to the box, it has everything you'd want in a toothpaste: fights cavities, gingivitis, gum disease, brightens teeth and removes stains (ironic if the staining mouthwash rumors are true -you brush your teeth to get rid of stains only to get it back again!). However, it terms of taste, I didn't like it. While the color is a cool mint blue, it leaves your mouth with a strange burning sensation. I am a long time user of Colgate Total, and have never experienced this type of stinging. Strangely enough, it leaves your mouth with the effect that Listerine does! But I much prefer Colgate because I prefer my toothpaste to be bland - I'll leave the stinging feeling to the mouthwash.

There you have it. So I have mixed feelings about this kit because I couldn't verify where the mouthwash really leaves brown stains as other reviewers have pointed out. Time will tell, and I will update my review accordingly.",1374105600,0,0,1,0,0

Pros:
*The nail polish adhered to the nail and polish instantly
*All three of these polishes apply smoothly with no streaks or bubbles
*The polishes are thick so they don't run easily and make application that much easier
*Total dry time is less than 5 minutes. In less than five minutes my nails were completely dry. No more smudges!
*Stregthens the nail - I can notice a difference in the strength of nails after applying this polish.
*The result is a beautiful glossy finish that does not chip or peel
Cons:
*I could not find any cons with this polish

Pros:

- jet current is very strong on 10. If you're getting a weak jet, you are probably using the wrong nozzle. (That's what I did to break it! See notes at bottom)

- angled jet nozzle sprays water behind and between teeth, where a brush can't reach

- water jet is gentler on gums and teeth than brushing, massages gums

- leaves my gums tingly w/ the clean feeling of having been freshly sandblasted

- very fast warranty response and parts replacement

Cons:

- I really hate the flip top storage compartment. It gets in the way when trying to lift off the lid to fill water. Also, there are 4 slots, but 5 nozzles (not counting the one inserted into the handle), so one of them has to sit loose inside the lid.

- flimsy feeling handle and coiled hose

- no real difference between 6 on the dial and 10 while using turquoise nozzle

- very noisy and creates a lot of rumbling during use

- takes up quite a bit of space on my limited sink countertop

All in all, a good product for the price and a good investment in your dental health. When I first got this unit, I was using it wrong. I chose the narrowest head (yellow) and cranked it up to 10, thinking I'd get the maximum blast force for my money.

The jet felt very weak, but I continued to use this configuration without trying the other nozzles, until 2 months later when the spring fell out of the operating handle and broke apart. I found out from customer service that yellow should be set to 3 maximum. They promptly sent me a new hose/handle (arrived in 3 days from CT). Replacement was very easy and took 5 mins.

Even in those 2 months of sporadic use before breaking, I noticed an improvement in my dental health. In conjunction with the Waterpik, I have also been using an Oral B electric toothbrush and floss. My gums stopped bleeding after 2 wks of initial use, a problem I've had for years with manual brushing.

So now, I use the turquoise head on 10. Very powerful and leaves me feeling fresh, although still noisy with the rattling.",1244160000,0,0,0,1,0

What I wasn't expecting was that my hair would feel so wonderfully soft and full after the first wash! It lathered beautifully with just a dab of shampoo, rinsed easily and without being fly-away or unmanageable at all, my hair is really so soft. I'm kinda stunned. (As I always do, I rubbed actual coconut oil on my hands and then ran my hands through my hair before blow-drying. But I've always done that. My hair has never felt this good so it isn't because of the light coconut oil finish.)

This cream doesn't really smell anything like coconut oil, but more like a clean baby -- I don't know why.

To note -- at the time I ordered this I didn't realize it was coming from a company in the UK, where I'm not. They delivered in a timely manner, given that the package was sailing across a very large pond, but I'll look for this product from a US distributor the next time I order.

It is not color treated. I have some flyaway hair and split ends, but nothing too overwhelming. My main concerns are shine enhancement/retention, ease of combing out, and body retention. My hair can take some pretty heavy conditioning without flattening out.

This conditioner left my hair very soft and made it easy to comb through my wet hair after shampooing and conditioning. It's creamy and thick so you don't need a large amount for coverage, even with relatively voluminous hair. While this didn't do too much to enhance shine, it didn't dull what I already had. I found that it smoothed hair a little less (some ""frizzy"" parts) than some conditioners in the lower portions (despite my attention to even distribution) and did a better job smoothing the top. It did not suppress the natural waves my hair has or weigh it down.

All in all, I think this is a pretty good conditioner, but it may work better for someone with younger hair who doesn't need so much in the way of shine enhancement.",1428537600,0,0,0,1,0

This one is a lovely slightly violet polish in the red range. It's perfect for people like me who wear a lot of cool colors and have blue based coloring. The color in the bottle looks exactly like one in the photo on my screen, and slightly more red when it dried on my nails. I like it a lot. This color glides on very easily and almost covers in one coat. I did have to use a second coat to completely cover all the little spots that I missed the first time around. The polish looks good on its own, but the gel topcoat really sets it off. It gives my nails a hard, very shiny finish and helps to protect the manicure. It also smoothes out any imperfections that may have occurred when applying the first two coats. Don't skip it! The topcoat can also be worn on its own over bare nails for a nice shiny, finished look. But with so many beautiful Essie colors, why would you want to?

This polish was still going strong with only a hint of wear on the tip of one nail after 7 days. The top coat was still extremely shiny. My nails show growth at the base of the nail, so I usually change polish after 7 days. But if not for that, I probably could have gotten another couple days out of this polish.

Because alcohol can be absorbed through the mucous membranes of the mouth. Being friends with people taking Antabuse, I know they are cautioned about using mouthwash for that very reason.

Because of that, this is safe for kids as well as adults.

The flavor - I am much more used to a milder flavor with wintergreen. This has a very strong, almost biting flavor. But it does leave me with a clean feeling in my mouth. At the time I tested this, I had a severe ear infection and was unable to open my mouth except for the tiniest amount.

My son has a medical device (dex cgm) that includes a sensor attached to his body that is a little bigger than the larger nail wraps.  It gets boring and it's nice to change up how it looks a bit.  The larger nail wraps do a great job of changing it up and adding a little fun at times to the dull medical device.

These nail wraps are a little smaller then others we've had so they don't  cover the entire sensor quite as thoroughly as others we've used, but it's decent.

Nail wraps work much better than stickers or things like that.  Nail wraps look more like they are painted on, like they belong there vs stickers.  Plus this devices gets a lot of wear and sticks don't last and look awful quickly.  We also typically cover the sensor with a clear tape and it sticks to  stickers and so even covered they come off as soon as the tape is removed.  Nail wraps, are more oa nail polish and last a long time - they can last a few months if you don't decided the change it sooner.

While the Tattify wraps are a little small, I LOVE that they offer a lot of boy and make teen appropriate designs.  The hard part of changing the look of medical devices has always been finding designs that a boy and especially a mail teen likes.

The second use - we have a teen daughter.  Our son gets the bigger ones for his sensor, our daughter gets the small ones for her nails.  It's a great double use and win win all around.

I'm wearing Bogota Blackberry by OPI on my nails right now (a great deep burgundy color), but I'm aching to try this purple shade. I've seen it for a few weeks now on the toes of my Pilates instructor. She and I are both olive skin toned women of medium-dark coloring, and we carry deep tones well. This particular color she's been wearing--ie, Essie's Bermuda Shorts--looks nicer on toes than in the amazon pic. It's a strong purple that retains depth and brightness. And the fact that one pedicure has lasted her weeks (it's  now finally chipped and wearing off after nearly four weeks!) makes me want to try Essie for a change. (I've been a diehard OPI gal for years.)

So, I give the color a thumbs up for its compatibility with the season's color obession, and also for its plain old purple happy-joy-joy fun look. And for those of us who want quality, my observation of how this has endured on my dancer/excercise physiologist/Pilates expert trainer, who is constantly barefoot and using her toes, this is a great polish that wears nicely and lasts a loooooooong time.

Bermuda Shorts, here I come.
