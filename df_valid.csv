Or if it was a 'get all this other stuff free when you buy the toothbrush' kind of thing. It's all you need for a healthy mouth in a re-usable little tote. And if you happen to be a dentist looking at this, there is cute little 'luggage tag' attached to it that has a sleeve for your business card. In six months when your client is using the tote for groceries, they just might look at that tag and remember to make an appointment!

Now lets look at what's inside.
First, there is one of those toothbrushes that syncs with a fun little device that tells you how you're brushing. GREAT for kids, but really nice for adults, too. It will even tell you if you are brushing too hard or soft. I love it! It does everything but reach in your mouth and brush FOR you.
The included toothpaste is slightly runny for a stand-up tube, but tastes fresh.
Next there is the Crest mouthwash. They claim it doesn't sting, and they're right. The mint lasts just long enough, with some others it spoils your taste buds for hours.
Finally, some dental floss. I prefer flossing picks but it certainly completes the package.

I always have ongoing problems of uneven skin tone and under eye dark circles. This special blend of serum is formulated to target signs of aging including dark spots, skin dehydration and dull skin tones. Unfortunately, it is exactly what I need at this point of my life. It may not be fast and effective against deep wrinkles though, but nothing really is other than cosmetic surgeries. The serum is quickly absorbed into the skin and does not feel greasy or gel-like silicone texture that a lot of serums have. It does have a pleasant light scent which quickly dissipates after applied and the consistency of the serum is somewhat creamy. It spreads very easily and one pump is enough to cover my face so the bottle should last quite awhile. When I apply this serum after cleansing and toning, I immediately feel as if my skin has been infused with moisture. It soaks right in and makes my skin feel more hydrated. It feels smooth and luxurious when I spread it over my face and neck. I have not experienced any irritation or negative reaction to this serum. Nevertheless, it is gentle enough to apply even under my eyes without any burning or itching sensation which has happened with a lot of beauty products I tried over the years.

I really adore the elegant packaging, it comes in a beautiful airtight pump style bottle which protects the ingredients and keeps them fresh. It's sanitary and dispenses just the right amount for each application. I instantly love the way it makes my face feel soft and supple on first use and the results over the past week alone have continued to smooth my skin significantly. My face looks and feels more smooth, firm, and has this radiant glow that makes me look so much energetic. It has also helped balance my overall complexion. Even though I have exclusively been using this serum for about a week. I do not expect it to work miracles, but if it can hold moisture to the surface of my skin to give it the appearance of being smoother, then it is doing exactly what I need it to do. I do notice after using it that my skin feels tighter. I have not noticed any change in my fine lines yet, but the texture of my skin is starting to look better already. I am pleased with what I have seen so far and I am fully aware that I should give it at least a month to see results just like with any skincare product on the market. I will continue using this serum to document what my results are over time.

Disclosure: I purchased this serum at a discount for my honest opinion.",1460419200,0,0,0,0,1

8324,5,"06 16, 2015",AT53ZTTO707MB,B00WHM2OS0,"This water-soluble cleansing oil cleans gently, but very thoroughly.  I wondered about the water-soluble claim, so I tested it by adding water to a small puddle of oil in the palm of my hand.  It immediately dissolves into the water and creates a white liquid.  Washing my face with that white solution left my face and my hands soft, smooth and squeaky clean.

This oil is meant to be applied onto a cotton pad and the pad used to wipe off makeup.  I find that technique works very well for clingy eye makeup.  I don't use heavy foundation, so I don't need an oiled pad to wipe it off.  But after removing my eye makeup, I like to work a bit of oil onto the rest of my face, then apply water as I work it around my face.  It is a very effective way to clean your face.

5892,5,"08 29, 2017",AW7BIYHXUIZ62,B00W259T7G,"This is a GIANT bar of dense soap.  Much more than a handful and quite heavy.  The pomegranate version I received smells absolutely wonderful, even through the cellophane packaging.  The speckled pink color and imprinted Pre de Provence logo also makes for a very attractive presentation on the sink or in the bath.  Obviously, all of this makes one anxious to finally bathe with it - and it doesn't disappoint.

A smooth creamy feel.  Those little speckles are hard particles that will provide a stimulating scrubbing and exfoliating action against the skin.  Mild lather.  It does burn if you get it in your eyes.  As expected, the smell is pleasant and bold and makes bathing a treat.  Rinsing seems to take more than average effort, as this soap is rich and tends to want to hang around.  After toweling my skin was literally squeaky clean, if you can appreciate that analogy.  An hour after drying . . . skin (including my face) was no longer ""squeaky"", but clearly felt moisturized and soft.  The scent lingered mildly, not so much pomegranate, but rather a clean soapy scent.

This is a fine, luxurious soap.  The experience with it is much different than using even the better regarded mainstream American store shelf soaps.  After a couple of uses, I've hardly diminished the huge soap bar, I expect it will last weeks.

I THINK THE LITTLE BIT OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SERUMS IS THAT RHIS ONE HAS COQ10. I HAVENT SEEN THAT UNGREDIENT IN OTHER VITAMIN C SERUMS THAT I HAVE TRIED.

IVE BEEN SEEING LOTS OF ARTICLES AND POSTS ON VITAMIN C SERUMS AND CREAMS IN MAGAZINE ARTICLES, ON LINE, ON TELEVISION, AND ON BLOGS, SO I DECIDED TO GIVE IT A TRY AND IM ABSOLUTELY AMAZED WITH THE RESULTS THAT I GOT!

AT THIS POINT IVE TRIED 6 DIFFERENT TOPICAL VITAMIN C'S, THIS BEING MY SIXTH, VITAMIN C PRODUCT, AND FOURTH THAT IS A SERUM AND NOT A CREAM.

I HAVE A REALLY BIG BELLY BUTTON SCAR FROM MY TUBLIGATION, AND THIS IS THE THIRD SERUM THAT I TRIED ON IT. I AM ON DAY 9 OF USING THIS VITAMIN C PRODUCT,. THIS IS WHAT I HAVE DONE WITH THE PREVIOUS VITAMIN C SERUMS AND WILL DO WITH THIS ONE TOO AS I AM ALREADY NOTICING A CHANGE ON DAY 3. FIRST, I STARTED OFF USING THE SERUM ONLY ONCE A DAY TO SEE IF I ACTUALLY SEE RESULTS, AND TO MAKE SURE THAT IT AGREES WITH MY SKIN AS WELL. AFTER 3 DAYS OF USING IT MY SCAR HAD NOTICABLY LIGHTENED UP AND I HAD NO TROUBLE USING IT, SO I INCREASED MY DAILY USAGE UP TO TWO TIMES A DAY, I WOULD APPLY IT IN THE MORNING BEFORE GETTING DRESSED AND AGAIN AT NIGHT BEFORE BED. I HAVE 5 CHILDREN, SO I DO NOT HAVE A SET SHOWERING SCHEDULE, I THROW ONE IN WHEN I CAN, SO OBVIOUSLY WEATHER IT WAS MORNING OR NIGHT I APPLIED THE VITAMIN C AFTER MY SHOWER.

THIS ELRIQUE NATURALS VITAMIN C SERUM IS A CLEARISH LIKE IN COLOR SERUM AND HAS A THICKER SERUM TEXTURE. I LOVE THAT IT IS NOT COMPLETELY THIN LIKE WATER. I DO WISH IT WERE A HAIR BIT THICKER, BUT THE PRODUCT IS AWESOME AND DOESNT DESERVE A LOWER RATING BECAUSE OF IT.

I used it on one side of my mouth, on my lower back teeth which is the most sensitive spot in my mouth.  The next day, I put cold water in there and swished it around.  It was still sensitive, but I didn't have the screaming sensitivity that I usually have.  I think with continued use, this can dramatically minimize the sensitivity.

The strips are kind of hard to get off the sheet.  I wasn't sure if I was doing it right, and there weren't any instructions.  You have a big sheet of plastic with a little piece of the sensitivity strip in the middle.  You have to peel that part off, but it doesn't come off easily.  It is a little tricky to do.  I didn't notice a taste.  You aren't supposed to eat or drink for 30 minutes after you use them and you only leave them on for 10 minutes.

Today's razors are so much better than years ago.

Even though this is a wet or dry shave razor it seemed to drag a bit when dry shaving. Maybe because of some slight perspiration I don't know, but it did not move smoothly over my skin. Than I thought of Williams Lectric Shave, something I have heard of for years but never tried.

The first thing I did when I got it home was smell it and was not impressed with the odor, in fact I thought it was extremely unpleasent. I figured I'll use it to shave, than wash it off and that will be the end of it. But NOooo I shaved than washed it off 1 time, 2 times than a third time and the smell did not disappear from my face or hands. Plus the odor lingered for hours. I don't know if it is just me but I think the smell is just awful And I would not buy it again just for that reason. I would check out the other brands on the market.

As for the actual purpose of this lotion, I was impressed it worked exceptionally well. The razor glided over my face without any kind of drag and evidently did what it was supposed to since I got an exceptionally close comfortable shave.

So 5 stars for the shave and 1 star for the Odor. I have plenty of after shave lotions that I really like and resent the fact that I am forced to use there odor if I want a good shave. Odorless for this product would be a definite plus. My 2 cats won't eat any treats I give them if I have this odor on my hands, at least I have 2 paw's up on my assessment of the odor.

I had to scrap my old one after my cat chewed through the little tube leading to the jet, and was very pleasantly surprised to discover that the design has been improved in several ways: (1) it has a smaller ""footprint"" which takes much less space on my bathroom counter; (2) it is significantly quieter, so I can now use it late at night without fear of disturbing the neighbors; (3) the little tube to the jet is now designed in such a manner that when you replace the jet in the bracket after use, the tube coils neatly and disappears into the body of the device (safe from little cat teeth); and (4) the whole device is more streamlined and attractive-looking.  Others have correctly noted that the well for holding water is not as large as in the older models, however I have not found this to be a problem, and it only takes a second to add more water if you need it.

6241,5,"10 21, 2015",AMLOQUXG3USTY,B013TXDDJY,"I ordered these pre-applied gel body patches because I had never tried them before. I have a friend that applies body wraps at her salon but I honestly just can't afford to go as often as I'd like. I love the results of body wraps but I just wish they weren't so expensive! I've tried a few other brands of the DIY wraps and honestly I haven't found one yet that DIDN'T give me the results I was expecting. If you've never done one please don't expect that you'll go from a size 13 to a 7 or even a 9 with your first wrap but you should drop a few inches. And normally I would say be prepared for a mess!

This my favorite DIY wrap so far. They have not only already mixed everything for you before purchasing but they have actually already applied the gel straight to the cloth.  Normally it's a PROCESS and the fact that these are pre applied saves so much time and made it so much easier to do. There was literally NO mess. The pads are sealed individually in their own foil packaging and wet. It's easy to stick it in the desired place (I chose my tummy but you can use these for arms, legs, and your lower back as well.) You will need plenty of saran wrap to secure the pad in place and wrap the film around your body tightly to keep it secure. I took it a step further and wore my waist trainer with it as well. That was a first for me and I honestly think it made a big difference. I usually see about 1.5in difference in my measurements before and after a body wrap but with the waist cincher I was actually able to lose 2.5in. That's a full extra inch! The results are not permanent but for a special occasion or date night I love them. It is suggested to wear the pad for 1-4 hours. I actually wore mine all day with no irritation and took it off right before my shower before getting ready for my night. It does help to tighten the skin but you should be realistic in your expectations. Again, you cannot go from a size 13 to a cut 6 pack after a few hours lol. It does make a noticeable difference however and I recommend trying them if you're interested at all.  The price is fantastic, especially compared to the salon price I paid a few times and I'm acheiving the same kind of results. (Better results really but I'm assuming that was from the added waist cincher.) The real bonus for me though is the no mess factor! That will keep me coming back for this style, it's soooo worth it!

The packaging is really nice. It comes in a magnetic closure box with 2 hair clips and a cute light weight black zippered pouch.
My experience with this cool innovative hair straightener was very surprising and pleasant except when I kept holding the paddle a bit higher, then I would burn my hands.
But I learned the hard way to hold it correctly. LOL
My hair sheds a lot too so a lot of hair got in the brush but while it was hot, I was able to lift the hair from the device.
I have wavy hair but I used the Hairika paddle brush on a curly hairstyle I previously had done the day before and as soon as I ran the brush through my hair, I immediately saw my hair getting straightened.
I also realized not just too brush the hair normally but to hold and lift out the hair that needs to be straightened then place the paddle brush straightener on to it.
When I tried the lower various temperatures, it was not getting out the curls but when I switched it to the higher temp of 210 C it flattened my hair and no burn or damage was present.
It gave me a nice smooth and silky finish except not pin straight hair which is ok because I like a little wave on the tips but it did take out the curls as you can see in the pictures below.

Overall, this is a great product. The concept of a rubberized ceramic paddle brush with heat technology and LCD light display with plus or minus temperature buttons is Genius!
And the instructions enclosed are very easy to read and understand.

I agree that a low battery light would have been nice, but this isn't a big deal since the battery lasts a long time and can be charged in 1 hour. Plus, if you don't have an hour to wait around a quick 5 minute charge will get the job done (or you can use it corded.)

Now, as far as the shave goes it gives a very close shave with no irritation. It is a little faster than previous models but don't expect to cut your shaving time in half. I tried a foil razor once and it left a few stray hairs here and there which it refused to pick up no matter how hard I tried to get them. I switched to a rotary and I haven't had that problem since. I switched to electric razors a few years ago when my face just couldn't handle blades anymore; I thought I'd have to sacrifice the closeness of a blade for a healthier face but this hasn't been the case with Norelco, they have consistently given me blade close shaves.

I've had this razor for about 6 months now and couldn't be happier. I've read the reviews on the Arcitec and, honestly, can't see a good reason why I should pay 2 or 3 times for it when this one works so wonderfully.",1258329600,0,0,0,0,1

LIKES:
- It is the perfect size
- It can be the perfect hair accessory for many up-do's but even if you do decide to wear your hair down, it will add a nice touch of femininity and romance.
- It is not super white in my opinion. I feel that it is a more like a pear or creamy white. ( I am horrible at describing colors so I am sorry.) I like that it is not a true white but you might need something different.
- The wire is flexible so you can position the flower to your liking and complement your hairstyle.
- The clip works nicely
- It looks handmade

DISLIKES:
- I think that it is handmade because the flower petals have rough edges and the construction seems to be that sturdy to me.
- Also, the packaging is not the best because when I received it some of the petals of the flowers wore bend and squash together.

5453,5,"11 11, 2014",AEC90GPFKLAAW,B00NO3KZMS,"With two daughters, we've owned our share of curling and flat irons, almost all bought from Walmart or some other discount type store.  They did a decent job but usually died in a year or so - and one memorable Conair straightener caught on fire (luckily without anyone's hair in it!).  When I had an opportunity to try this Ivation professional-grade flat iron I wondered how it would differ from the ""civilian"" ones.

I'm happy to report that this flat iron really is better!  The ceramic plates slide effortlessly through my daughters' hair, without leaving a tortured, ironed look to it.  They had shiny, bouncy hair without any crimp marks or damage, and they could even make flips and curls by using this iron.  The actual plates are attached with a pivot, so they ""give"" a little as you use them.  I'm not up to speed on what infra-red and negative ionic energy does for hair, but my daughters assured me it takes away frizzies and adds the shine I mentioned above.

The iron heated up extra quickly, and we were all impressed by the digital-slider adjustment for the temperature.  The 9 foot cord with a swivel puts an end to tangled cords and standing near an outlet, and the auto-shutoff will never leave you wondering if you left something turned on at home.

I expected this to cost at least $60, but the price is not much more than a Conair or other brand we've tried.  Overall this is a very well made and useful flat iron, and I might even be tempted to let the girls tackle my curls and give it a try.

I received a black Ivation Professional Flat Iron (it comes in several colors) for testing and review purposes.  I wasn't asked or expected to leave a positive review, and this is my honest opinion of the product.",1415664000,0,0,0,0,1

They are clear, but different from ceramic braces. The bands used for Radiance braces are specific and they stain VERY  easily.

It was also obvious the product was helping to exfoliate his skin. It looked healthy, and not in need of a good spa day. He was in fact using this before bed every night and within a week there was a noticeable difference. I know I have photos of his blotchy skin and I will take one today of his clearer skin and add it to the review. I am hoping he continues using it and sees what I have been trying to tell him.. take care of your skin with a product that works and your face will not ooze.

1706,3,"12 17, 2007",A2V1J3JT5OOZFO,B000PKMA2G,"I have used Norelco shavers for many years and prefer them to all other models I have tried. This review comes from much experience with the brand.

This Arcitec design looks fancy and works well, but gets three average stars because it really works no better than the previous non-space-age, less expensive designs. The 1050, 1060, and 1090 all operate the same, they just have a different display: none is better than the other, and don't waste money on the Cleaner accessory. It is fairly comfortable to hold (I prefer the feel of the original model because this is one is smaller), and looks fancy sitting on the counter, but it does not do a better job. It requires cleaning after each use as there is no space for the hairs. I have always cleaned my shavers after each use anyway. Unless you just want the apperance, it is not worth the extra money.

Technically: The triple-blade per round head (each cutter has three spinning blade areas) does not do any better than a double cutting blade. Kind of like a Saturday Night Live skit in the 70's, Jim Belushi said, ""Buy a triple bladed razor. For those that will believe anything"". Lift-and-cut is a ridiculous concept and a marketing ploy, but Norelco's do a nice job. Norelco went back to more diagonal openings with this model, which is good. Many other newer models have lots of little pin-holes which are worthless, as the hairs have no time to enter a small hole with shaving motion. You would have to set it directly on a hair to cut it. The less pin-holes the better.

Feel: The head design feels better on the neck, and has not caused razor-burn if I do not stretch the skin tight like I need to with the original model. It takes the same time to shave as my older unit, and I get no better results, no faster. It takes the same time to get a smooth shave, and the same persistance in some areas.

Function: It is a little bit easier to shave under the nose, above my mustache, but not a major difference. It is much harder to trim my sideburns with this unit as the heads almost cut my hair on my head above the ears the way it is shaped. Very poorly designed trimmer, so I use my older shaver for that.

Battery: Early, new battery life is good, as with most new battery devices. But, it states to not over-charge. Meaning, you need to be around when recharging to unplug it after it is charged; not good for those that shave and must go to work. The other units would shut off after charging.

Cleaner/Charger: Again, one needs to be around when it is finished to not over-charge. The cleaner is not necessary and a waste of time, money, and chemicals. I use a razor brush from an older unit, brush it out quickly over the wastebasket (one can't blow it out without getting hair dust all over the bathroom, and it can't be shaken into the wastebasket as easily as the older models), and I spray it quickly with Remington Silicone Lubricant (I can only find it at Wal-Mart, which is the only thing I ever go there for, by the way).

Overall: Buy it for looks and keep your old one in the drawer for sideburns. Nicer on the neck.

I would return it, BUT, it was a gift, AND I like the look of it. I know, I know!!

The strength of the smell did die down after a couple days.  And about putting it in my soap holder, this bar is so big it barely even fit, much bigger than your standard bar for better or worse.  Better in that it will likely last almost twice as long.  Worse in that it is almost too big to hold (and probably is for people with small hands; I will not name names).  I guess I never put much thought into what Pomegranate smelled like, and now that I have taken a long strong whiff of it, I cannot say it is my favorite smell.  But more importantly it does leave me feeling clean without drying my skin and that is really all you can ask of your soap.",1504396800,0,0,0,1,0

Adorable
Beautiful turquoise color.
Easy to see design.
Reasonably priced.

Cons:
Difficult to take off the sheet
Can only use one side if you have long nails.
They curl a little when you take them off the sheet.

I LOVE these wraps but had to give them four stars due to the difficulty removing them from the sheet and them curling when you take them off as they can stick to themselves and then they are unusable.
I have read some bad reviews about this product and I have to say, I am wondering why there are bad reviews. I applied mine two days ago and have washed dishes a number of times without gloves, took a shower, cleaned the house without gloves using chemicals, typed, among other activities were I use my hands a lot.  I have not had any issues with the decals.
I have a few suggestions when applying them. This is what I did, maybe it will help others.
1,. Know which nail will get which decal before you start.
2. Trim if necessary before you remove them from the plastic.
3. Have the design laid out as you want it to appear on you nail.
4. When you are ready to apply, clean your nails with an alcohol wipe to remove all oils.
5. Carefully remove the decal.  You may want to use the wooden stick they include with the package go prevent the decal from rolling on itself. You do not want to use your finger because if oil gets on the decal, it may not stick right.
6. Carefully apply the decal.
7. Use the wooden stick they give you to smooth out the decal.
8. File off the extra with the file the give you.
9. Put at least two coats of clear polish on the top of the decal.  This will not only give the decal a nice finish, but it may last longer.

Make sure the decal is not on your skin.  If you are concerned about the decal being too small, paint your nail the same color as the decal so when it is applied, it is difficult to see your nail until it grows.  I am VERY happy with this product and have had far less problems with this product than Jamberry.  I found this product better than Jamberry as Jamberry split apart leaving part of the decal affixed to the nail, and the top layer coming off.",1451347200,0,0,0,1,0

I do have very fine hair and this works great. I wouldn't recommend it for thick hair - you'd have to use far too much of it. But for thin hair that gets limp fast if the product has too much wax/silicates, this gives volume without weighing down hair.  I didn't have to use a lot of styling products afterwards that always seem to make my thin hair stiffen and flatten.

A small ball rapidly expands as you put it in your hair, so a little goes a lot way.  I use this on days when I need a bit of extra conditioning - for meetings and such.  It is more expensive than store bought conditions but on par with salon varieties.  And I do trust the Fekkai name.",1407801600,0,0,0,1,0

4978,3,"09 8, 2007",A3SMR4HRFJARSC,B000FOI48G,"When I was a child our family bought the first WaterPik that came onto the market. The whole family used it for many years. The area where the water came out was small and the spray could be directed easily. It did not make a mess. It was fantastic for cleaning my teeth, which had braces.

Now that my son has some orthodontia, the dentist suggested using a WaterPik.

This thing is unbelievable. The spray comes out so fast and the spray is so wide, that it makes a huge mess. Even I, a coordinated adult, have a hard time using this without spraying down the bathroom walls, mirror, and countertop. This is a mess. I am worried the wallpaper will be ruined and will begin peeling off.

Tip: Put the device in the mouth, then turn it on. Try to use it with your mouth closed or nearly closed and shut it off before you remove it from your mouth.

After reading other customer reviews, to prevent possible leakage, we take the unit apart and dump out the water after each usage.

Do your research regarding other models available as well as this one. The customer reviews here on Amazon are eye-opening.

I wish they made the WaterPik like the original ones that lasted for many years and were easier to manage.

Update: One child has been using this for 16 months and it is still functional.

Note on my star rating: For effectiveness for the job I'd rate it 5 = I Love It but for the mess I rate it a 1 = I Hate It which averages out to 3 star rating = It's okay.",1189209600,0,0,1,0,0

The convenient pump dispenses the correct pea-sized dose that is recommended for brushing.  Children should still be supervised to make sure that they don't swallow the toothpaste to avoid fluoride toxicity.

The plastic container stands upright and holds 4.4 oz. or 124 g.  It has a cap that is easy to remove and replace but which smears any excess toothpaste left on the pump dispenser.  The dispenser opens and closes automatically so that the cap is not needed in routine use.  The safety-sealed containers that I received have an expiration date 16 months from receipt.

I am very pale, and have auburn/reddish hair. This color SHOULD in theory look pretty spiffy on me, but I can't get past the fact that it looks like a GLITTERBOMB exploded on my face. What the ..>?!?!?!?!? And easy to overdo? Yes indeed! This blush is very very silky and soft; use a light hand. You can always add more but woe be to anyone who overapplies it. You'll look like a feverish clown!

For us (ahem) older ladies, try the Deep Throat. Pretty much the same color, without the glitty garbage all over every pore on your face!

UPDATE: I have the Orgasm/Laguna duo (reviews and photos and comparisons to other products coming soon) and it has been sitting ever since my horrifying discovery out in daylight, that there were glitter bits on my face from using the Orgasm blush. I have since discovered---your brush makes a LOT of difference. I switched to a very fluffy Real Techniques brush instead of my usual blush brush; it deposited gentle color and the glitter was very iffy. (As in, you couldn't really see obvious glitter but if you were verycloselikethis you could see tiny bits) I have revised my review a little bit. Still giving the advice that it's easy to overapply and, this color is sure not for everyone, but I don't want to shoot it with a silver bullet any more. If your skin has any tendency towards redness at all, I implore you to do a test run with this before you count on it looking good for any important (or public) event!

I wasn't too sure about this magnesium oil, I have never used it before but wanted to give it a try. This is a generous 12 ounce bottle with a spray top for easy application. It felt strange when I applied it,...leaving what felt like a residue on my skin, and at times I felt a bit of stinging /itching. I found if I spray a lighter misting over my skin it isn't that bad and the more often I used it the less I felt the itching. I also used it on the bottom of my feet as directed.

I didn't notice this doing much for me, but it seemed like it worked very well helping with my husbands leg cramps and sore back. He had been getting really bad leg cramps at night, this magnesium oil has lessened his leg cramps and also seems to have brought him a bit more relief from his sore back and muscles, but that could have just been the back rub working too. I just spray a bit on his back, shoulders, and the back of his calves before bedtime and he sleeps better and wakes up feeling less achy. Before using this he would have to stand in a hot shower just to get his muscles working well enough to get his day started.

Before I used this I searched online for information on using magnesium topically, and according to the information I read it is easily absorbed through the skin and many people have benefitted from using it. It can nourish and moisturize your skin and is a safe way to up your magnesium intake, along with providing quite a few health benefits. I will continue using this to see if we notice any more health improvements.",1424822400,0,0,0,0,1

I told them this in the store, as if it did any good.  SO, for all you out here who love the vanilla scent, try this, also sold on Amazon:

Monoi Tiare Tahiti Coconut Oil Vanilla -- 4 fl oz
Sold by: Express Health
$11.26

It is made in Tahiti and has a real vanilla bean in the bottom of the bottle.  Because it has coconut oil in it, it solidifies at 68 degrees, but all you have to do is put it into your hand and it melts.  It smells SO GOOD!  It also has Tiare flower scent in it that the Bath & Body Works formula had as well as Vitamin E and actual vanilla bean fragrance from a real vanilla bean.  It is only 4 ounces, but a little goes a long way and is only $11.26.  This is a body lotion and it smells awesome and is the closest thing to the B&BW formula I could find with a reasonable price tag.

I enjoy this product immensely because it leaves me skin moisturized without the heavy residue most intense moisturizers do. After two straight weeks of using this moisturizer, I have concluded that it works every bit as well, or better than the name brands I have been paying more money for at the department store. This moisturizer leaves my skin comfortable, soft, and matte all day long. The scent is delightful in my opinion and I find myself terribly addicted to the wonderful aroma. Even though it feels light on the skin, it helps my makeup glide on smoothly with absolute moisture. It feels like it disappears as soon as it is rubbed in, and yet it keeps my skin perfectly balanced and moisturized all day without the shiny greasy looking. I especially need something to help my sensitive skin stay hydrated and soft. This moisturizer seems to have just the right formula for that purpose without causing any breakouts.

This facial moisturizer is rich and creamy. I really appreciate that this product is not greasy or sticky. When using this moisturizer, I can actually feel it sink into my skin pretty fast. It instantly makes my face feel very smooth and it soaks in rather quickly without leaving any uncomfortable residues. I have been using this cream twice a day and always making sure to cover my eyelids as well. It is so gentle for my sensitive skin that my skin does not itch or turn red. It is not greasy, but the coverage is thick enough to sufficiently provide moisture for night time. I do not like oily or sticky moisturizers, but I do prefer certain degree of a good moisturizing coverage. This is a very good face cream compared to many other brands of moisturizers that I have used not to mention the fact that it is made by skin healthy ingredients and botanical extracts.

I have only been using it for two weeks and I have noticed that my skin is starting to feel smoother and firmer. However, there has not been much difference in my fine lines yet, but I strongly believe it will further benefit my skin with consistent use. The tone of my skin also seems to be improving and I could not be more happier. This is a good facial moisturizer that I find perfect for my skin type during the day since it has helped my makeup look natural and smoother. I will definitely recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin looking for a good face cream to provide adequate moisture and combat signs of aging.

My eye area is soothed after I use this ( I use it morning and night). I apply the gel to my clean eye area daily and follow with a denser eye cream at night. I'm a college student that experiences many late nights. These late nights have a habit of causing me dark circles ( so not cute, haha! Makes it very obvious I stayed up all night to write that last minute paper) this has certainly been helping lighten and brighten my under eye area! It disappears into the skin almost instantly, so applying eye makeup and foundation over it is no problem. I actually think it makes my make up look better, it acts as sort of an eye primer. Loving this eye gel so far, will revise if anything changes!

Actually, I think I saw such a difference the first time I used this that the other two days just couldn't compare.  So, my idea would be to offer the product as a one time use for a special occasion or weekly application.  But it would need to have a little more product of each of the three components. I did not think the packets contained enough product to justify the expense or make it feel luxurious.  The 3 day booster at $19.97 is expensive for such a small amount of product I think.

The shaving peformance is fine for me -- not as close as a wet shave but that's a good thing for me personally because the closeness of wet shaves makes my face break out.  Every 3-7 years I buy a new Norelco and they get incrementally better each time.

I'm writing to warn about one feature.  Every shaver I'd had up to this one had a physical slider switch to turn it on and off.  This models has a push button.  This means you can't tell BY TOUCH whether it's on or off.  This is critical for me because I usually shave in the car (sitting in traffic) with the stereo blaring and I can't hear the shaver (especially since the newer models are pretty quiet).  I turn it on and off a lot as traffic conditions change.

Further, when the battery is low, my previous shavers would just run slower and slower until they came to a gradual stop.  This one slows slightly (imperceptably to me, really) and then just ""falls off the cliff"" and stops cold.  So you don't get any warning really that it's about to run out -- if I knew it was running down, then I'd shave a lot faster!

And this is where the tactile power switch feedback is important:  if the battery's totally drained, but I'm not done yet, I'll leave it off for a minute and then turn it on for 5-10 seconds of shaving before it dies again.  With the push-button power control this is really confusing because you're never really sure what's on and off.  It turns out the the power button is like a pulse that gets sent to an internal microcontroller (I'm guessing), so after it's been off for a while the power ""position"" doesn't matter, it's really off.  You just push to reboot the thing.

So, my 7825XL was robbed out of my car last night and I'm buying another one of these, so I guess that's an endorsement.  But I'm bumping up to the next higher model with better battery status indication ...",1108339200,0,0,0,1,0

5078,5,"08 3, 2014",A2CQ2X9H9HY6W0,B00DT4757A,"First and foremost, I received this product for free to review by the company. Since I have already fallen in love with their mask/scrub ""Get Refreshed"",  I had high hopes for this. Luckily, I wasn't disappointed. I must also point out that I have very oily skin that also has the tendency of being very sensitive. Things can break me out in a heartbeat so I'm always very cautious. Despite this company using oils in their line, they seem to use oils that are safe for acne prone skin.

Many people with oily skin stay away from products containing oils however, this is not a good idea. Yes, certain oils can wreak havoc for us but that's only if they're not the right ones. We needs moisture just like everyone else. Avoiding oil based products is a myth and can lead to your skin becoming more imbalanced. And if that's not bad enough, premature aging.

Now for my assessment. More Than Clean is really impressive. The product is like a greenish color, smells awesome and is thick consistency. Though it's a cleanser, don't expect it to foam or soap up like a traditional one. A little goes a long way and you use it on damp skin. I rub it in and let it sit for a 3 minutes before washing it off in order for it to penetrate. After washing it off with lukewarm water, it's amazing. It leaves my skin feeling tingly and really clean. I get absolutely no shine despite my face feeling lightly moisturized.

Yesterday, I used it with my Clarisonic Mia and got even BETTER RESULTS! I haven't used it long enough to have pore shrinkage though. One thing I do notice is that my skin feels tighter but not in a dried out way. It's like the same feeling you get after a really great facial at the spa. I'll keep using and update on pore shrinkage because I do have a a problem area which is my nose (especially the sides).

Benefits of the main Ingredients:

Peppermint: It contains menthol that nourishes dull skin and boosts the texture of oily skin. This oil is best to keep your pimples at bay and your face blemish-free.

Lavender: Benefits include that of being antiseptic and anti-fungal which helps to reduce scarring and speeds healing. The essential oil is also an anti-inflammatory and circulatory stimulant.

Apricot Kernels: Apricot kernel seed & it's oil gently moisturizes skin. It's used to moisturize balanced skin, oily skin and hormone reactive skin.

Sage: Assists in improving acne, chapped skin, and relieving symptoms of eczema and psoriasis. It is soothing to acne-prone skin and a refreshing toner.",1407024000,0,0,0,0,1

When I saw this facial cleaner, I thought that all of the different heads that were included with this set made this a great value. I placed the order and this was shipped to me quickly. I am finding that similar products found on sites like Sephora can be found so comparable here on Amazon, and this brush is no exception. The facial brush is very gentle on my skin and this really deep cleans my skin well. This requires only two AA batteries and is powerful and easy to turn on and off when in use. I use the pumice attachment tonight on my dry feet, and this is great! It is abrasive enough to rid of my dead skin, yet it does not seem to harm my skin. The large bristle attachment works great for the body, and each attachment is easy to put on and take off. The only attachment that I have yet to use is the sponge attachment. I will use this 2-3 times a week, and I feel that this gives my skin the needed deep-clean to ensure a smooth complexion. I received this product (very kindly) for free during a special promotion. I treat each product that I review as though I paid full price for it. There are many up-and-coming companies with new products that they want people to test and review so that they can have their name and product out there.

I have tried every over the counter product available only to find eventually they burned my eyes, or made matters worse. I came across these products on accident, however it was a great accident.

I am 33 years old, not pregnant, an avid bike rider, and live in the hot state of florida. Being in the sun all day takes a toll on you. I began using the sweetsation spf30 and spf50 products  for when I ride my bike, and to a great surpise they do not wash off with the heat or sweat. Not to mention the ingredients are truly organic with no chemicals. NOt many people understand the effects of chemicals, but eventually they all will enter your bloodstream and potentially cause damage.

The night cream is super hydrating, not greasy at all, which is a great bonus. It has a light mild fragrance, but its a natural fragrance. When you put it on immedietly you feel and see a difference. I didn't even expect to see a different using any of the sweetsation products, I just wanted sun protection and something for after the sun. HOwever, the second you put it on, your face must really like it because you see a difference that almost takes your skin back years. The plus is it is all natural. If you are someone who uses moisturizers regular, stop with the high end products and over the counter products, they really are full of chemicals and don't do anything for you, but perhaps cause more damage.

Yes, the price is a little higher, however, they actually cost less because you need much less, literetly a pea size will cover your entire face. In the end, the health benefits and cost outwiegh any product available on the market.

The best part of this product line is the customer service. I contacted the company a few weeks ago with a question about the spf30. The owner emailed me back an hour later on a saturday evening with helpful tips and suggestions. She is really kind and understands we all work hard for our money. It is not often you will get the owner of any company to return your questions, but she really cares, and it is obvious she cares about your needs over making profit. I am a doctorate learner, almost finished, and as such I read people while. This company is one of a kind, and should be highly rated as such.

If your using one of the products and have a simple question like I did, email customer service on the sweetsation website. You will get an immediete response. I am not very girly, so I felt kind of silly with my question, but she did not make me feel such and helped greatly.

You won't regret buying from this line, and I assure you customers needs are priority.",1284076800,0,0,0,0,1

The problem though, as I'm sure you'll agree, is that it is so DANG bright outside because of our friend, The Sun. Fortunately, this sleep mask helps to solve that issue for me!

Pros:
* Does a good job of blocking light
* The memory foam design ensures a comfort fit EVERY time.
* Comfortable, lightweight material
* Adjustable quality velcro strap for custom fit

Cons:
* Really, I can't think of anything! This is a great mask!

My opinion:
This is a GREAT mask! I love the memory style foam - it is comfortable and lightweight without applying a bunch of pressure to my face. Yet, despite the lack of pressure, the quality (by that I mean that it isn't thin, low end elastic) elastic adjustable band doesn't apply an uncomfortable amount of pressure.

I'm much bigger than the average woman so doing anything like this in an actual spa is out of the question. While this does say it's good for losing inches I mainly got this to try because it also said it helps reduce stretch marks; yes I would love to lose inches since I do have some clothes that are a little too tight I also would love to be able to see my stretch marks be gone.

I have only used this kit once so far as you only need to use it once a week for 6 weeks and then once a month but I can already tell you that I love it. This kit is super easy to use as it's got clear step by step instructions. The kit comes with 2 ace bandages and 8 packets of clay powder so you do get enough to be able to see if it'll even work. I love how relaxing this body wrap is and for a complete hour I get to relax while the clay sits and does it's magic.

I have sensitive skin and didn't have any problems at all using this kit; in fact the clay actually made my skin feel really soft and smooth after using it. I did notice that after just one use that my skin did feel like it was a little tighter than it normally is. I'm absolutely looking forward to the next 7 times I get to use this kit!

It uses a NiMH battery pack, which means there's no memory effect and you'll get more than 1 year of use out of it (versus NiCd which is a horrible battery chemistry that some cordless devices still use).

It includes 3 different trimmer guides, 2 of which are fully adjustable. This prevents the need to keep 15 different guides. Unfortunately, the adjustment is difficult to use. I had trouble increasing the depth because of how the thumb button was designed.

The unit itself is very sleek and unique. It comes apart into 2 pieces for easy cleaning. The battery pack is the bottom half while the upper half houses the motor, transmission, and blades. Unfortunately, the trimmer does not stand upright by itself. It would have come in handy, although I am sure people would do that and it'd fall onto the ground, hence why Philips designed it to lay flat on a table.

The negatives of the trimmer are far and few. The blades are very noisy, and there's no full charge indicator. The LED ring just glows RED to indicate it is charging or fully charged. The trimmer also does not include a pouch.

Overall, it is the right price and offers the same functions as a normal corded Wahl trimmer but without as many guides. The only drawback is that the guides aren't as easy to use.

Pros: NiMH battery pack, simple to clean and use.

Cons: Noisy, trimming guides aren't that easy to use.",1248825600,0,0,0,1,0

During my day, I think about and look forward to deciding what mask and/or cream or treatment I am going to use when I get home from work each night. It is a calming self-soothing approach (like meditation or yoga) that helps me keep my sanity. I have used gel masks, overnight facial cream masks, and peel off masks. I use a variety of masks that you apply and then scrub off (like glamglow, natura bisse, mud masks, etc.). I recently discovered these paper masks from My Beauty Diary. I get a facial once a month, and my wonderful esthetician has explained to me that peptides are the latest breakthrough believed to be the key to relaxing wrinkles and smoothing skin. I was very excited to try these based on the ingredients and the reviews.  The first thing that I noticed was the lovely packaging. The box is beautiful, and inside are eight (8) seals packets. Each packet contains a paper mask soaked in serum. You very gently remove the mask from the package and spread it across your face. It has  adequate holes for your eyes, nose and mouth (although you don't want to eat with it on - not that big, and it will cause food to get into the mask). The serum/liquid is very soothing and soaks into your skin as you enjoy the very pleasant sensation of this mask on your skin. The scent is perfect. It stays wet for a very long time. I often wash my face, and then put this on while I watch tv with my husband for a few hours. I remove it after approximately two hours (you could leave it on for less or more time - but it will fall off if it completely dries). Use the extra liquid/serum in the packet and apply it to your face/neck after removing the mask. The mask leaves my skin soft and supple. I really like these, and will be buying more. For the price, these are an incredible find. If you enjoy pampering yourself, you can't go wrong with these. Highly recommended.",1454112000,0,0,0,0,1

The active ingredient is 0.07%  cetylpyridinium chloride, a quaternary ammonium cation antiseptic.  Research has shown that it has a small beneficial effect in treat gingivitis and preventing plaque and it is generally regarded as safe when used for short periods of time.  However, I do not think that using antibiotic agents on or in the body on a regular basis in the absence of an infection is a good practice because it interferes with normal, helpful bacteria and can cause health problems.  Oral microbiology in particular is complex and disturbing the natural balance of microorganisms could cause harmful species to proliferate.

I have very dry skin and make up crepes under my eyes as a result.  Yes, I've tried many other creams (specifically, every one olay has ever come out with); I've also tried setting it with different powders after watching youtube videos.  For me, powder was the worst choice.

Since most beauty products cater to oily or combination skin,  I imagine that those of us with truly dry skin are more of a minority and so it's reasonable that this won't work for a lot of people.

But if you're like me and you could probably cover your face in olive oil and think, ""damn, now my skin looks nice"", this might be for you.  It is truly the only thing I've used that doesn't make my concealer or foundation crepe.

One reviewer compared it to Vaseline, which it is definitely not.  However, I can see where she was coming from.  It's thick and oily and just what my skin needs.  It also lasts longer than any dermatologist would recommend keeping it for.

3686,4,"07 29, 2008",A2TO2BN3P4C00L,B001AMRQ2W,"I just received this razor as an upgrade to the Philips Norelco 7110X which I had been using for the past 19 months.  While one would expect this razor to perform better given its list price (approximately double what the 7110X is currently), I was frankly surprised by how much better it is in almost every regard.

I previously reviewed the 7110X, so if you want to see what I found lacking in that razor the review is available under that product listing.  As to the superior qualities of the 8240XL, they are:

1.  Shaves are closer and do not require as many passes over the same area.  I still don't think it gives me as good of a shave as a manual razor and shaving cream, but I've never found an electric shaver that could compete with a manual razor in terms of closeness of shave.  Sometimes I prefer the convenience of the electric shaver, however, so that's why I use both methods on occasion.

2.  Feels more solid in the hand.

3.  While it isn't quiet, it sounds less annoying when it's running.

The only serious problem I've encountered so far is with respect to charging the razor.  The manual indicates it may take 12 hours to fully charge the razor before the first use.  I had mine plugged in for over 15 hours and the light on the razor indicated that it was not yet fully charged.  I decided to keep the razor plugged in and use it.  After I completed shaving, the charging light briefly indicated it was fully charged but then started indicating it was still charging again.  I decided to unplug the razor anyway.  I re-checked the manual.  Unfortunately, it's written to cover three different models, so not everything in the manual pertains to this specific model.  Even so, the drawings indicate charging lights on the razor that simply don't correspond to what's on the actual unit (for example, I don't see anywhere on the unit that the word ""Full"" would illuminate), and there's no indication in the manual that these drawings only pertain to other units.  Strange.

Before owning my Philips Norelco 7110X, I had also owned another Norelco model (more similar in quality to this razor than the 7110X) and some other models from Braun.  I've generally been pleased with Norelco electric razors, and this one is another winner.",1217289600,0,0,0,1,0

I have to admit when I first received it I really underestimated it and didn't think it was going to work as well as my hand held file. I was totally wrong. I use a hand held file in the shower about once or twice a week and after using this I will not go back to the hand file. This remover is so much easier and faster. It's easier because I don't have to use any pressure whatsoever, I had to get used to this I really felt like I should be applying maximum force to help get this callous removed but with this it's just not necessary and in fact it just slows the tool down if you apply pressure. I was also worried that the surface area of the tool would not be wide enough, and it really doesn't need to be, it's just so efficient and because of the smaller size I can be much more precise. I have smaller callouses on the edge of my big toe and side of my foot, I could not get these very well with my hand held file so I pretty much just leave them and concentrate on the heel. With this tool I can get them perfectly. Using it it super easy and it's not painful at all, if you have any limitations that prevent you from using a hand file you should really try this out, it takes no effort at all you just guide it around the areas you want to file and that's it. I have used this in the shower with no issues but because it's much less of a mess than my manual file I prefer to use it after the shower so I can really see what areas I need to focus on. The battery life seems great I have used it about four times on the same charge and it's still going. If you have a large callous use this every day for a couple of weeks (just dot a little each day so you don't get sore!!!) then apply a nice foot cream and then you can get to the point of just maintaining and do it about once a week.

The product comes with the sticker sheet with several sizes of nail stickers. It also comes with a set of directions a wooden cuticle pusher and a nail file. The concept is simple. All you have to do is cut the nail sticker to fit your nail and you peel and stick. Any edges that are too long you can use your nail file to precisely cut it along your nail Edge. I was a bit skeptical about this product as it does not require Heat and is basically just a sticker. I have had the product on for a couple days and have had minor lifting and none have peeled off. if you cut the sticker a little short from the edges of your nails you cannot tell a big difference. And I was able to easily do this to my right hand with my left and there was no drying time. The only thing I did not like was the pattern. It looks a bit pixelated and copied.

I purchased it as what I thought would be a special use product and didn't expect it to become a daily thing, but it exceeded my expectations and made me wish I gotten one years ago.  I initially got this because I wanted to irrigate gums and teeth during a bleaching process I was having done at the dentist.  My hope was that using this after bleaching would help limit the sensativity I was experiencing from the bleach residue from the home maint part of the process - just rinsing after was not doing a good enough job, and my gums were becoming irritated. This product did the trick and solved all the issues I had with the bleaching process.  In addition, I noticed an overall improvement in comfort when brushing and I didn't even know my gums could feel this great. I thought they already were fine, but this product just really improves overall dental health.  Love it.

I got this model because of the additional piks that come with the unit and the storage case for those small parts, as well as the smaller foot print - it just seemed better designed then the more basic unit. To me it has been worth the price.  Since this was my first water pik, I did go through the initial introductory process of drenching myself and the bathroom mirror on the first use, but after I got the hang of it found it very easy to use.  I use the regular pik and tongue cleaner the most and do use the product daily. The chord storage is great - the coil chord holds up and stays neat after use (could be a tad longer though).

I found that it didn't want to start working..or pumping actually when I attemped to prime it so to speak as the directions tell you. I set it up for that and after many minutes nothing happening. HUH...I was aware others wrote in that it was dead on arrival. But I could hear the pump being actively trying to work...just no water. So I ever so slightly lifted the corner the pump hole is on the water canister facing the pik it's on your left side towards the front corner...anyway I lifted it just a real tiny amount like maybe less than 1/4 inch or even no more than an 1/8 even. And a couple bubbles came up and I set it back down seating it again and the water came through right after that. So it was an air lock. That simple and that simple a fix but sometimes an airlock might be larger than the few small bubbles I had emerge. So you might have to work it a bit  maybe even shake it back and forth gentle of course. This kind of information might be helpful and prevent returns in the future.

It has a good lather and the bits of almond in this soap provide extra exfoliating benefits. I adore its scent, as well. When I open the bar and place it in my soap holder, the whole bathroom smells of honey and almonds!

I'll never order soap from another company, Pre de Provence gets everything correct. The bar size is great and the soap lasted my husband and I about six months! I just ordered another scent from Pre de Provence, but I think I'll come back to the honey and almond after this one is gone, I miss it already...

I just wish the liquid didn't evaporate so quickly.  <Hint, if you want to have your liquid last a while, put only about 1/5 of the bottle in at a time, you'll only clean the razor about once a month anyway, and it will evaporate in about 2 weeks.>  But it being part alcohol - that makes sense that it evaporates.  The shave is close, although rough on the skin.  The head doesn't move as smoothly along my face as my old norelco.  Another positive is that is uses the same recharging cable as my old norelco (I think all norelco chargers are the same).

Now the bad.  At home, this razor was perfect.  It has about 80 minutes of juice in it and i only need to charge it about once every 3 months, since I have a secondary norelco I keep in my gym bag and use that one when I'm at work.  My secondary battery finally wouldn't hold a charge, so I had to replace it with my new 9170XLCC.  Well, every time I would take it out of my gym bag, the head would be popped open.  This is because the button to open the head actually sticks out from the body, and anything can snag it and it will spring open.  You don't even need to 'press' the button, you just need to touch it.  Well, today it was, as usual, popped open.  The only difference now is that it won't close.  It probably twisted a little while in the open position and now the blades are unaligned with the head, and it won't snap shut.  I can get a piece of tape and tape it shut, which works, but that is not the point.  Norelco had done a great job before by creating a recessed button on my old razor, but now this button that sticks out can snag on anything.  Not only is it bad in the sense that the head can twist when popped open, but I also have little hairs all over the bottom of my bag because it kept popping open.

So that's my review - it worked as a razor, but don't plan on travelling with it.  Even when you place it in a glove box/cupholder, that head will manage to pop open.  It was a poor design flaw and I'm very disappointed that norelco would send something out like this without any type of travel-testing.  I mean, what's the point of a cordless razor if you can't take it anywhere with you?",1232496000,0,0,1,0,0

Better than any brush or comb I have used. It's really quite fabulous for teasing and adding volume. It's a cute brush love the rainbow bristles as well  The mirror is an added bonus to look at my hair, or makeup..

What I don't like about it is it's a little too rough for my thin hair. Dry it easily detangles but wet it seems a little more rough and pulls much more hair than my other brush.  Maybe I am losing hair anyways but it seems a little rough for my thin hair. Overall I think its a great brush, especially if you have thicker hair you might really enjoy it.

- Appears to be well made

~CONS~

I would recommend using sensitivity toothpaste while you are using the strips, it helped for me. It made my teeth noticeably whiter. I would suggest you take a picture of yourself smiling before and after. I noticed the whiteness of my teeth when I saw a picture taken recently and I couldn't believe how nice they looked. I just had to dig up an old picture to compare and it was a big difference. After I have noticed this in the new picture, I love smiling for pictures now and showing my teeth. I was alway self conscious about it before.  That alone makes it worth the price.

I was very satisfied with my results. Make sure to read all the instructions before using.

It just became a part of my bedtime routine, not a bother at all. I just put one on while I was watching my evening TV programs and just kept an eye on the clock.

5838,5,"09 8, 2017",A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV,B00W259T7G,"This is an average-sized bar of scented French-milled, French-made soap designed to over a more luxurious experience than consumer-grade soaps. I will be comparing this both in use and in price to average body bars, but my rating takes into the account that this is a premium product which offers certain benefits that you cannot get from products like basic Ivory soap or Kirkland's body bar. This gets extra points for those added qualities.

I will note the price differences first. This is a 150-gram bar for a little under $5 whereas a 130-gram bar of Kirkland signature will cost you an average of 66 cents. Both bars will get you equally clean, but that is really the only point where the products overlap. Besides the truly lovely rose scent of this bar (it smells like a real rose  mild and not too overbearing, but present), it has a much better feel. The lather is creamier and feels silkier on the skin. One point about it that I was really happy about was that it wasn't so perfumey that I walked out of the shower smelling as if I'd applied a scent to my skin. This was more of an enjoyable transient experience in which I enjoyed the scent while I was using it, but didn't subject others to it once I was out of the bath. In my case, my husband is super sensitive to perfume-like smells so this worked for me. If you're looking for something longer lasting, this may not be what you're after.

In terms of how it leaves my skin, this is absolutely better for not drying my skin out. I'm guessing that this is the shea butter replenishing to some extent what oils the soap is stripping off when you use the soap. I wouldn't say that you don't need an added moisturizer after using it (at least I still needed moisturizer), but it's definitely gentler than other bars that I've used.

The bar is very hard or solid in a way that consumer-grade bars are not. This is because of the quad-milling that is advertised on the product page. I had not heard about this process before trying this soap, but it reduces the water content of the bars and makes them last longer. I will note that my average bar of soap will tend to melt in the shower and there are little stalactites of soap residue on my soap dish on my shower caddy where the soap has dissolved and the residue has drained off and hardened (which represents a loss of soap/value). This soap doesn't do that. It dries harder and firmer and doesn't melt away at the edges. That means that it lasts a lot longer. I can't do a scientific test or anything, but my best guess is that I got 3x the mileage out of this bar than the Kirkland bars that I usually use (and possibly 4x the use compared to Ivory, which I find melts away much more rapidly than any other soap). This is still a more expensive soap on average than consumer-grade brands, but it isn't quite as expensive as it seems when you factor in longevity and the quality of experience is rather markedly better in terms of the feel and the scent.",1504828800,0,0,0,0,1

1111,3,"01 19, 2016",A331BHAR0TRLWT,B000EGMC74,"I originally bought this cleansing cream to remove makeup and dirt like a cold cream. I have been stripping my face using harsh cleansers and wanted to ease up yet still get rid of makeup at night. This cream kind of confuses me. It does seem to remove makeup, including mascara and liner, well. But then I end up having to wash my face after because it leaves an oily residue which is not good for my skin. It's mineral oil  which is like a barrier which keeps moisture out but, at the same time, keeps it in as well.  It forms a sort of seal between your skin and anything you put on it and anything that is under it. Anyone who is prone to clogged pores will probably break out if they leave this on their skin.

However, this brand is certainly not the only cream cleanser to use mineral oil as its main hydrator and cleanser. When I use this Queen Helene Cream, I always rinse it off so I am still washing my face like I was but at least the product is hydrating and not harsh. It doesn't strip my face of its natural oils and, when I wash it off with a warm washcloth, my face feels soft.

But what I really wanted was a no rinse cleanser for those lazy nights when I want to remove make up and dirt and hydrate all in one step. I may be able to leave this on my skin and not have issues but I prefer to remove the oil and use something a little more aging skin friendly. Still, if you're looking for a creamy cleanser that gets the job done and is cheap, this does work. I will use what I have but I don't think I will replace it when it is gone.",1453161600,0,0,1,0,0

The fabric is held together by solid stitching which was flawless on my mitt. It is super strong despite being thin. The fabric is rather surprisingly rough when you rub it against your skin. It's like sandpaper that does not do any damage. It leaves your skin feeling smoother and cleaner after use because it so vigorously rubs off outer dead skin cells. If you have thin or super sensitive skin, I'm not sure how this would feel. I'm the sort of person who scratches hard, so I loved this. It felt effective and it felt invigorating. The type of rough stimulation likely stimulates blood vessels close to the surface of the skin. I wouldn't be surprised if it had positive effects in terms of cleaning through increased blood flow.

The only point about this which I was not happy about was the inner seem around the elastic band at the bottom (see photo). The interior is stitched well, but it is also sealed at the edges with what seems to be melted plastic. Mine had sharp edges that I had to trim off with scissors in order to stop it from digging into my wrists uncomfortably. This ragged edge should be more refined. Though cutting it off isn't difficult, I'm concerned that cutting off too much will result in fraying the elastic resulting it in eventually unraveling so one must trim lightly and carefully.

This is the perfect product to put on your high heels if you are in a park for a wedding , birthday or even at a church function outside.

They work very well and they don't let your heels get messed up, the big round bottom don't let your heels dig in the dirt which is great because you won't go out of balance.

I love that it came in a nice little mesh pouch and you can put them in your purse or in your car so when that time comes you are prepared.

This is a also a great gift for all the bridesmaid if your wedding is taking place outside. The mesh pouch comes with a nice ribbon for a gift.

Bare Minerals 'Natural High' blush is the perfect blush. This is a long-wearing, water resistant formula . This is a solid mineral  formula and the color is the perfect blush for everyone.  It has a slight petal peach color and highlights the cheekbone and apples of the cheek. I use my primer, then brush on foundation, I then use the mineral blush on the apples of my cheeks. I finish the application with Mineral Veil, buffing the entire face.  This is a  long lasting blush for the face. This is the most perfect blush I have found. The blush has a silk like consistency, and one application provides the same look.

Yes they're a little pricey (they're not your three pack of soaps, ok?) but they do last a very long time on average and they produce an amazing amount of lather. And they have incredible scents while not being overwhelming (amazing in the shower, a slight lingering on the skin which does fade).

I will caution if you get some of the 'brighter' soaps (with some dye in them, such as raspberry or jasmine), they do leave a little color residue on white or pale washcloths that DOES wash out. But some people might be concerned about that so I figured I'd mention it.

The scents are refreshing and true to their names, and the lather doesn't dry out my skin. There's a nice mix of one notes (sage, raspberry, jasmine, mint leaf), some two notes (rosemary mint, fig grapefruit), and some unique ones (mirabelle, angel's trumpet) - some of these also help exfoliate the skin as well as have the shea butter.

I switched to electric razors a few years ago when my face couldn't handle blades anymore. I thought I'd have to sacrifice a close shave in order to get a healthier face but this hasn't been the case with this shaver. The shave is almost as close as a blade and I have absolutely no irritation. I upgraded to one of the speed XL models and this one is slightly slower, but not so bad.

There are only 2 downsides: It takes 8 hours to charge and you can't use it corded. This is not that big of a deal though since you'll still have plenty of time to finish when the low battery indicator goes off.

At this point I couldn't recommend this shaver if you have already used a rotary and know you like them and for a very simple reason: it is obsolete and buying replacement heads is almost as much as a new razor. However, if you are looking for a traveling razor or want to give rotaries a shot then this might be the right choice. A few years ago I would have highly recommended it.",1231027200,0,0,0,0,1

This soap is a nice thick bar that's easy to hold.  It arrived a bit soft, as if it didn't have a long cure, but that could be from a higher shea butter content, as really high content shea butter tends to be soft like that. In any event, I didn't feel like sitting it around to attempt to dry it out further, I wanted to use it!  (So I did!)  It smells of green tea but it is not a very strong scent.  It's attractive, olive green and has the Pre de Provence logo etched into the bar.  It came plainly wrapped in cellophane.

It lathers very well.  If you work it, it develops into a creamy foam - another reason I suspect the shea butter content is high.  It leaves skin very clean and with a green tea scent that clings lightly- for hours if I'm not that active.  My husband and son also like it.

The green tea scent is like the smell I'd experience smelling a cup of brewed green tea, it is NOT as sharp as the famous perfume by that name, and it is much more subtle, and natural smelling than that.

This is a soap that you need to allow to dry well after use, because it is soft, and it will degrade if left in a wet area for too long.",1503878400,0,0,0,0,1

Since this was being offered at the same price, I decided to give it a shot, despite my concerns over the AV comparisons and the mention of menthol.

To begin with, I've never tried AV. But I have smelled it at the store and every time I've done so, my response has been the same: ""Nope.""

This has some similar elements to AV (the comparisons are fair in an effort to give people an idea what this smells like), but the two products are a little different, with the Lustray Blue Spice being far superior (and more subtle) in my opinion. There's more of a powder element to it and while the pepper is evident, it's not overpowering. Unlike with AV, I don't feel like I'm getting kicked in the face by Bruce Lee when I smell this. That being said, if I were going to be kicked in the face, it would definitely need to be by Bruce Lee. Am I right? Yeah, you know I'm right.

Also, this does have a slight kick due to what I expect to be menthol. But it's not Skin Bracer menthol; it's far more subtle.

As someone who is a big fan of Spice and who is not a big fan of AV, I don't mind recommending this. I don't enjoy it as much as the original Spice, but it's a nice alternative.

These dried lavender blossoms are very potent too. We only used about half a handful. So, we still have almost the entire bag to use for later. It will last for a long time. These would also be great for making clothing bags. If you place a little bit in a cheesecloth type bag and place it in your drawers, it makes your drawer and the items inside smell incredible.

I use eye creams and serums on a daily basis and twice a day because I find this area tends to reflect signs of aging sooner than the rest of my face. My goal is to always keep this area hydrated and moisturized at all times because of this!

Valentia's True Glow Eye Cream comes in a glass bottle with a pump action top. The product advertises as being an Intense Corrective Eye treatment, which not only works as a preventing regimen but also aids with current issues. The eye cream helps with:

Reducing Fine lines and Wrinkles
Restoring Radiance by helping repair and nourish the delicate skin around our eyes
Hydration from oils to Anti-inflammatory ingredients to reduce puffiness that may further diminish the appearance of aging skin.
Tightening the area around the eye by aiding with elasticity and targeting dark circles. which can make a person look tired and cause an irregular skin tone/color effect to the area.

Retail Price Point: $25.00 via Amazon for a 1.18 ounce glass bottle with a pump action top.

Verdict:
I always give myself about 3 to 4 weeks when it comes to trying any beauty creams and serums. I need to know if the effects I experience belong to the product I am testing or they are just the remaining benefits from the one prior. I can then also get an idea how well a product performs! The first week of trying the eye cream from Valentia, I noticed the product tends to linger longer on the skin than my former eye cream. As much as I love quick absorbing products, my prior eye cream left no residue but also no hydrating protective layer. It would just vanish within four hours and if the day was even breezy in nature, I could feel that tight feeling your skin gets when it's drying out too much. The True Glow Eye Cream from Valentia left a protective layer that kept my skin looking smoother longer through out the day. I used the product twice a day and experienced zero irritations from use. The thin layer allowed for make-up application after and no odd little rolled up residue balls formed hours later, or worse, when your make-up separates making it look like you forgot to blend. None of that happened! I did not notice fine line repair by week three, but I can state that the product is phenomenal went it comes to working as a prevention aid. I looked more awake because the skin in that area was smooth and naturally plump, not swollen from my seasonal allergies! My eyes water at night and when I sleep, creating what I call ""teary eyes"". I get red streaks from the irritation if I forget to apply eye cream or applied a poorly formulated one. I can state the Valentia's True Glow Eye cream prevented any red marks from setting in, so I woke up looking fresh and not like I have been weeping! This is an eye cream I would continue to use but also along with the Ultra Plumping Hydrating Mask from Valentia. These two products help each other out and I get a balanced appearance that is noticeable with this duo.

I received the above product(s) free of charge from Valentia. I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion. My review is based on my experience with the product and/or brand, which may differ from yours.",1456704000,0,0,0,0,1

It was the smallest little compact of blush I'd ever seen and I'd never spent that much on blush before. The next morning when I was applying my makeup I tried it, heeding the warnings that a little goes a long way. I was blown away!!

I went home and started using the Sonicare I had bought but never plugged in. That was good, but not enough - I bought a Waterpik because obviously flossing wasn't cutting it.

I had never used a Waterpik before, and it was some revelation! I'm still amazed that there are some Waterpik oldtimers who say this machine isn't strong enough...uh, for what? Peeling paint off a brick wall? This thing absolutely knocked my socks off when it came to the PRESSURE.

I started out at 2 and worked my way up to 7 - it still stings like mad, but I'm getting used to it by now. I put Listerine in the tank to increase the anti-bacteria result.

My dentist went on vacation, and I had to cancel another appointment, so it happened that almost two months had elapsed since the last time I had seen him. In that time, I faithfully brushed with the Sonicare four times a day and used the Waterpik at least once (several tankfuls of water and Listerine worth.)

Regarding the leaking people talk about - the only time the tank leaks, I notice, is if I put my fingers on the seal when I'm refilling it. If I'm careful to keep my fingers away from that seal, the tank is water tight.

So when I returned for my check-up, the dentist was AMAZED. He wasn't sure what I had done, but he said my gums looked pink and healthy! He had said initially I'd have to get my teeth cleaned every three months because I must be one of those people who gets a tartar build up quicker than other people...well, I had worked religiously on scaling back the plaque. (I had also bought a dental mirror so I could check the back of my front teeth for telltale plaque residue.)

Hmmm, no comment about that plaque...was it because there WASN'T any? My dentist asked me if I had been eating because there was so little build up (I had to tear that out of him because I KNEW he didn't want to give me credit for working that hard on my dental hygiene!)

The dentist HADN'T recommended a Waterpik, but I knew I had to go to the extreme to beat back the periodontal enemy. My teeth are so clean, they squeak!",1196467200,0,0,0,0,1

4424,5,"03 25, 2012",A25C2M3QF9G7OQ,B002B4VBV0,"I've used pretty much every Norelco out there from the top of the line SensoTouch 3D to their bottom of the line 6000 series. For my face, the HQ9 heads on the 8000 series continue to be the best the Norelco has ever produced. The extra row of rings really makes a difference compared with the HQ8 (and lower) heads on the lower models, which have only one ring of slots and holes. The shave is faster, closer and more gentle. I also find them to be preferable to the HQ10 heads on the Arcitec line (which I believe is no longer produced).

To get as good a shave (and a bit of a better shave on the neck and jaw line) you have to go to the RQ12 heads for the SensoTouch 3D. The HQ9 heads are a far better value -- you get 90% of the performance of the RQ12 heads at less than a third of the cost. Oftentimes the price of an entire 8000-series razor with HQ9 heads is less than the cost of just the replacement heads for a SensoTouch 3D.

What you give up with this razor is some build quality. Although these are made in The Netherlands (and not China as are other mid- and lower-end Norelco models) the build quality is still not as good as their higher end models. This is especially seen in the way the combs and cutters are held into place - it's just a thin plastic retainer system rather than a sturdy combination of metal and plastic in the 3D. You'll want to be careful when taking the heads out for cleaning so as not to break the retaining clip.

Other than the head retaining clip, the build quality is decent. Easy to grip even with wet hands. The built-in trimmer is somewhat poor, but it's hard to find a good trimmer on any electric razor. It comes with a stand, but it's only for storage and not charging -- you have to take it out of the stand to charge it.

The other thing you give up with this model is the ability to shave wet. For me that's not a big deal, since I use an electric to save time, and wet shaving takes twice as long as a dry shave. In the summer months when it's humid I'll use some Face Saver (Remington) which makes a dry shave just as comfortable as a wet shave. Should you prefer a wet shave and want to stay with a rotary, take a look at the Norelco AT830. It has RQ8 heads so the dry shave is not as good as this model, but the wet shave is very nice. I'd recommend pretty much any Panasonic if you're looking for a wet shave in a foil shaver.

While you can't wet shave with this, you can clean it under running water. I only take the heads out for a more detailed cleaning about once a month. Otherwise, just pop the top open, run hot water through it, and you're good to go.

Quiet, comfortable, fast, close and cheap. Can't ask for more from a razor. Highly recommend.",1332633600,0,0,0,0,1

Honestly, if I use this and then use regular floss string afterward, I never have anything come out on the string. I love this Waterpik! My teeth feel so clean after using it.

It is easy to use. You just fill the basin with water, pick your setting with the dial, and turn it on. It is a little messy - water run off - but it is worth it! I use it on the highest setting with no discomfort or pain at all. The different heads are all very useful and store right in the lid of the basin. It flips open and there is a compartmnt to keep them all. The coiled cord stays neatly in place in the holster when not in use.

I use a basin full of water, then refill with half water/half mouthwash and my mouth and teeth feel so clean and so smooth. It feels like I just left the dentist. It is also easy to clean from behind the teeth as well.

Anyone who is a slow cooking fan knows it can be a challenge to clean the pot or crock used. Using Dawn Ultra for Soaking loosens stubborn food considerably in a couple of hours. I think it is not quite as effective as Dawn Platinum but still an effective soak.

The scent of Dawn Ultra Original Scent is not unpleasant and is mild. Platinum's scent is more mild and for me less is better.

Both Dawn Ultra and Platinum require less product than Original in my experience. Less frequent purchases save shopping time and money. Both a plus.

The biggest differences for me between Dawn Ultra and Platinum are Platinum drying out my hands  and Platinum may be better for soaking.  In the summer when I'm not soaking as much I think Dawn Ultra is the best choice. Less drying out for the hands. In winter it's much closer. Ultra is a bit better as a soak.

I think Dawn Platinum and Ultra are very close in terms of cleaning. Both are an improvement over Dawn's Original formula dish washing liquid and worth a try.

It gives me a natural-looking healthier look even when I don't have a tan.  No orange or coffee cast.  What works for me is to apply it very lightly, on top of my usual make-up (although, to test it, I put it straight on my clean but moisturized skin and it looked great).  The other obvious thing is to make sure you put some on your neck to avoid a visible difference in skin tone.

Since it has tiny golden specks, it is wonderful as an evening finish but I love it for daytime, too.  I bought both the 01 shade for light skin and the 02 for olive or tanned skin.  I use the 01 on my winter-pale skin and the 02 in the summer, to improve the appearance of my natural tan.

She has tried waxing - too painful - and shaving would cause a lot of bumps and irritation, even with the Shick Intutition.

The trimmer is great.  Yes, Amazon should take down the photo of the storage pouch.  Yes, it won't get you totally smooth or bald.  Get a wax or laser removal if you want a total smooth finish. But it is a well built TRIMMER, which is painless and easy to use.  You can adjust the length you want, and you can easily work around the more sensitive and intimate southern locations.

Just take it easy around your bits.  It's helpful to use a mirror, assuming you're using it alone.  It's more fun if you have your partner help.  If you want the smooth look, use this handy device before you break out the razor and shaving cream/lotion. It makes it much easier and cuts down on irritation.

5057,5,"10 24, 2013",A2XNOB1T796Y6B,B00CZH3FGM,"I've tried some of the electronic toothbrushes before, but I think that the ones I've reviewed lately have impressed me enough to where I like them more than my water pick that I used. This toothbrush came as a kit, so I had a full line of whitening products.

First off, the toothbrush. It came with some extra head pieces so I'll have a relatively long time before I have to go out and buy anything to go with this, which I liked. Offhand I'll say that this unit didn't come charged and it took a long time before the unit could give me an actual two minute brushing rather than just about a minute or so. It takes a super long time to charge, as I left it plugged in for about 8 hours and it still wasn't fully charged. That's sort of a downfall when it comes to people who want to plug and go as soon as they get this (or take it on a trip right away), but it does mean that when this is fully charged it should last an extremely long time without needing a re-charge. I'll have to update more on the life span of the battery. I did like that this felt really good on my teeth and made for a nice clean. One thing I really liked about the newer units was that this toothbrush makes sure that you know when the 30 seconds are up and it's time to move to to another spot in your teeth. Very nice.

The toothpaste was good and like the previous toothpaste in the other set I reviewed, this looks nice as well as tastes nice and cleans well. Again, I'm slightly superficial in that I'd like a toothpaste that looks nice. I'll go for quality over style when it comes down to it, but it's nice to have something that didn't look like mystery gunk. The mouthwash was also nice.

What sort of irritated me were the whitening strips. I'll admit that I haven't tried any of these since they initially came out over the counter years and years ago, so I was pleased at how these have changed. These strips stay in your mouth very easily and don't move unless you plan on doing a lot of talking (they felt slightly loose when I was talking) or unless you don't set them properly. I learned that the hard way, but in good news you can fix any loose strips very easily. My only gripe is that these did leave some white spots on my gumline even when I tried to put these on very carefully. They weren't permanent, but it was a little irritating. There were also points where I think that the peroxide irritated my gums, but I think that was more of the liner rubbing against them while I talked. It wasn't a deal breaker by any means and my gums are a little overly sensitive at times, which I think was the main cause of this. I'll probably use these every 2-3 days rather than every day, which will slow down how fast these actually work, but I think it'd work out better for me.

Overall I was pretty impressed by this set. Unlike the other set I reviewed, the cost of everything separately is actually a lot more than what you'd pay to get this straight out. It's still a lot of money, but it's worth the investment so far. I didn't see a huge difference in my teeth, but this is really the sort of thing that takes at least a week or two to see any huge differences. I'll try to update later on the effectiveness and the battery life. So far, I really like this.",1382572800,0,0,0,0,1

5608,5,"02 26, 2015",A1BRCVMQ7C9CGJ,B00RAMAHA4,"This comes in a large container. It was a lot larger than I was expecting. It works well. It is a little hard to get out because of its tackiness and hardness. However, you just push your finger in and scrape some up and you will have it. You do not need to use much for most styles, depending on what type of style you're going for. I rub a little bit of this cream in between my fingertips and then rub it into the area of my hair that I want. It holds very well. I used this on my son's hair when he wanted a particular style. It turned out quite well. This is not sticky or greasy at all. It also does not get stiff. It looks and feels natural. It has a nice scent for men. My son likes it a lot and he uses it most days. I used it a couple times too. The scent is not strong or noticeable.

I like how natural your hair looks after using this. It does not leave your hair shiny or greasy. It looks very natural, as if you used nothing at all. Remember not to grab too much. However, if a little bit doesn't seem like enough for your particular hairstyle, then you can always grab some more. Rub it into your palms or fingertips first before applying it. I have bought the professional hair salon pomades and hair creams before. This works just as well as any of those, maybe even better since it's non-greasy and looks natural. Furthermore, this package is a lot bigger than what you usually get in the hair salons. So I think you definitely get your money's worth from this. I was so glad to be able to buy this product while they had a promotion going on. I think this is a great cream for getting that particular look or definition you want. They give you plenty of it too. This is well worth your money. In addition, it does not leave any white flakes in your hair. I have experienced that from other products. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.

Ps.  If this product is too solid or hard for you to use, just add a teaspoon of water and mix. You may want to let it sit with the water overnight to help soften it up. It then should be easy to use.",1424908800,0,0,0,0,1

You don't just open up the bottle and start rolling this little ball all over yourself.  It is very strong and long-lasting (hence the perceived ""high"" price for the size) And if you choose to add pheromones or cops to this or ANY LP scent, then you MUST operate under the ""less is more"" rule.  I learned the hard way, and I must say I became an LP ""believer"" afterwards.  I happen to like this LP Red scent and I got it with added Cops ""just for the heck of it"".  Let's just say I forgot I had put it on earlier in the day - I went to a school/social PTA event and got unusual attention from some of the dads there. And I was WITH my husband at the time. Very awkward for everyone concerned.  So I definitely think there is a ""science"" to the formulation, but as with all ""experiments"", the independent variable is the WEARER... everything from overdoing the application to wearing it in inappropriate situations.

This gel is an amazing 1.7 oz!!! This can also been used on your face as well, which is amazing it is a nice combination. I was able to get this product at a small discount in order to review this item and share it with you all. Okay, lets dive in, one of the key ingredients is martrixyl 300. This bad boy is going to kiss your fine lines away and leave you with soft skin. It does take a little bit of time in order to get that result but if you honestly think about it your didn't not get the fine lines over night. And it is less expensive than botox, and less painful. Okay where were was, ah yes this awesome formula also has plant stem cells that work magic because they have jammed packed full of antioxidants, fight off father time, and help restore collagen production. Which is needed to help smooth and firm your skin again. ALSO, please USE ON NECK! Day and night if you can remember because it will help. Then other very nice ingredient is Aloe which as we all know and love this is very good at healing your skin from scars. Th jojoba oil along with the licorice root helps fight off skin pigmentation and leave your skin moist but not oily.
Of course wear sunscreen daily with the product please. The vitamin E, frankincense, and the silk amino acid, will have your skin filling firm and hydrated through the day and nigh. One last thing, this is non-comedogenic and hypo-allergenic. This item does have cucumber in it that naturally reduces eye bags with its own anti-inflammatory properties. So not alone can you stay good bye to bags, but also dark circles.

Usually they feel really dry, you end up using all the top coat gloss right away and it still felt gross and peeled off. This is not the case! First of all, before applying make absolutely sure your lips are freshly clean and dry, no other makeup of moisturizer. After applying a very thin coat, let it dry completely before using the top coat. Do this and it will last 12 hours! It only faded a tiny bit after I ate greasy pizza and I only applied the top coat one time. It never felt after the initial application of top coat, in fact it felt like it had worn off completely until I looked in the mirror and was pleasantly surprised to see it hadn't budged!

Until recently, I've had no preference to any brand, as I felt they were all pretty similar.  After seeing some of the awards that Pattern Body Wash has received in various men's magazines I decided to try it for myself.

On opening the bottle, the fragrance was not overpowering or chemical-smelling, at all;  in fact, it was quite the opposite,  It has a great aroma with, not really a subtle scent, rather more subdued, and certainly not overwhelming.  In addition to nutmeg, I have also tried citrus, eucalyptus, cucumber, sage and black pepper, and all of them have been outstanding fragrances.  I was also impressed by the small amount of gel needed to clean the entire body.  Many of the other brands that I have tried seem to over-foam and usually leave a little residue that needs a secondary rinse to remove.  This is not the case with any of the Pattern products I have tried.  The body wash is silky, with just the right amount of lather, and it cleans exceptionally well.

One of the other areas, in which I compare body washes, is the dryness that ensues after toweling off after a shower.  Pattern is exceptional in this realm and leaves the skin smooth and soft, even in a very dry climate with little humidity.

The price point is certainly several dollars more than I would normally spend on a standard body wash, but in all truth, one bottle lasts longer than all of the other companies I have tried over the past 20 years.

The only priming I did was to use some sticky tape as if I were cleaning it. And I don't think that would have been necessary. It is soft, but not super squishy.  I like that it is clear. Pretty much any color polish will show up, and I can look through it for image placement. I like the protective cover that comes with it. I like the sturdy credit card style scraper.
The only drawback is the small size. I couldn't pick up as much image width as I would like without rolling or pressing really hard, and for some images this led to distortion. So that is why I only gave four stars.

The smell is terrible, however. You will want to be sure to wash it off your face after shaving.
The stubble that collects in my shaver also seems to clump and stick more with this product, which requires a little more cleaning of the shaver.
You should also wash your hands very well after applying it. If not, it will permanently stain/discolor your hand towels.
I also noticed that the plastic shelf in my medicine cabinet has melted in the area where I keep the Lectric Shave. I think some drips down the side of the bottle after I apply it, which melted the plastic.

It is not lightweight but it absorbs very well into my oily skin and leaves no oily residue!  Also i didn't feel any tingle or itching sensations like I've experienced before with dark spot correctors.

This review is for Maximum Cavity Protection for growing adult teeth, which is a new concept.  The toothpaste comes in a stand up container that has a press style pump.  You press the pump to express toothpaste, which is a sparkly green colored gel.

The flavor is mild bubble fruit and that is exactly the way the toothpaste tastes, with just a hint of mint added.  The toothpaste offers maximum cavity protection with anticavity  0.24% fluoride.  It promises to fortify weak spots on enamel and helps to reduce plaque buildup with regular brushing.  It also freshens breathe.  It does not have whitening properties, which is the only reason I deducted a star.  My college age daughter brushes with  whitening toothpaste,  so she will brush with this toothpaste first, for cavity protection, to reduce plaque buildup, and to fortify weak spots on enamel, then finish with a whitening toothpaste (like Colgate Optic White) or mouthwash, for whitening benefits.

The toothpaste tastes good and offers some serious benefits for growing adult teeth.  Perfect for my 19 year old daughter!",1470268800,0,0,0,1,0

The color is super subtle. I'm not sure I'm actually seeing any tint at all or just imagining it because I expect it to be there.
