8823,5,"03 9, 2016",A3BTWI08JEFYPE,B01BK49MZI,"I switched over to natural soaps a few years back to get away from all the chemicals our corporations drown us in.  I've found that most natural soaps are very good, it's the rare one that I don't like, just the fact that they are made with good ingredients makes the majority of the difference.  I am never averse to trying a new product in this area so when I was offered a discount coupon to test this product in return for an honest review I was happy to do so.

At 5.5 ounces the soap is a decent size and priced correctly compared to competition.  The packaging is pretty nice, although not a reason for me to purchase things but if you are giving it to someone as a gift or to try out it will make them comfortable knowing that this is not a cheap product.  The fragrance was a very nice lavender smell that is not too strong and slightly different than other soaps because of the addition of Chamomile Calendula to it.  From my standpoint I like the fact that the smell is not too overpowering, I'd rather not smell all flowery from afar.  I've got pretty dry and sensitive skin, and after a few uses I have noticed that it does help keep my skin moist, along with the Argan Oil I use.

Washing with this soap was easy, it lathers up well and does not leave any filmy residue that takes work to wash off.

I'm very happy with this product and will most likely purchase again.",1457481600,0,0,0,0,1

This is the nicest scented body lotion I've found in many years.  I absolutely adore it.  I let a female friend of mine try it but told her up front not to ask for it because it's one item I would not be giving away.  I am trying to use it sparingly so as not to use it up too quickly.  Sadly, I returned to the store that I purchased it from but they did not have anymore.  Each time I visit that store, I always check to see if more of this wonderful lotion has come in, but so far, it hasn't.  The price in the store was much less than what it is being sold for on Amazon.com.

I love a strong, earthy sandalwood, but this is not that. It is more of a soapy perfume with a hint of sandalwood. That aside, the large bar lathers up richly and when it is finally rinsed off, it leaves me feeling refreshed and clean. It doesn't irritate my skin, but like other Pre de Provence soaps, it cleans so well that it can leave it feeling a little dry. I would definitely get it again, but just wish it smelled more strongly of sandalwood.

I apply this twice a day, once in the morning and once at night. I always wash and clean my face before applying any type of product to my face for the best possible results.
The product is white it is not thick.  There are no perfumes in this product, which is always a plus. This product is made in the USA and is paraben free. This has made my skin extremely smooth and soft. I also apply this after applying the Deko serum as they are a great pair.

I love this lactic acid peel! The included instruction file is very informative. I do think they should have included a written printout with each order though, especially since that is the only way you would know how to use this product if you aren't familiar with using facial peels. There are tips and tricks that help you get the most out of using this product, along with other products sold by the company. For those that don't wish to download the file, or have receive this as a gift, here is a condensed version of the directions.

Always perform a patch test in an inconspicuous spot (the forearm is a good place). Leave the test solution on for at least 1 minute before washing it off with water. Wait 24 hours for any sign of irritation. Never use your peel around your eyes or on your lips.  Always use reasonable judgment.  If excessive irritation or stinging occurs, rinse off immediately and discontinue. Never use any products with fragrances or exfoliation properties for 48 hours after your procedure - these include retinol or retin-A products, benzoyl peroxide or other acne drying solutions and any and all `grainy' face scrubs.

1. Cleanse the skin thoroughly and rinse well.

2. With a cotton pad, wipe rubbing alcohol over your entire face and allow to air dry. (alcohol wipes work really well here).  A good toner or witch hazel can also work in the place of rubbing alcohol.

3. Wet either gauze, a cotton pad or a fan brush with1-2 mls and wipe over your face. Try to apply as thin and even a layer as possible.  Take care around the delicate skin  around your nose and leave at least a 2mm (1 inch) margin between the edge of your eye area and the peel. DO NOT rub into the skin.

4. Allow the peel to remain on your skin for 2-5 minutes, depending on your tolerance.  For your first 2 or 3 peels, never leave the solution on for more than 2 minutes. Watch your skin for signs of irritation.

5. Prepare a neutralizing solution of 1 Tablespoon of Baking Soda in a bowl of tepid water. This solution will immediately deactivate the chemical reaction.

6. Rinse your face until all water has been used.  You cannot rinse your face too much.  You should not feel any stinging on your face at this point.

After using the peel follow up with a good moisturizer. I like to use face serums with hyaluronic acid after using peels, it feels soothing to my skin. This facial peel really does work well, it has helped me get rid of the top dry and dull layers of skin, and what has shown up looks and feels softer and nicer. I really have noticed an overall improvement to the appearance of my skin, so I will continue using this every couple of weeks.",1415836800,0,0,0,0,1

I really loved it, the wash is silky smooth and lathers into plenty of cleansing bubbles without stripping moisture away...I think people who are used to soap and the tight extra clean feeling they get, find a moisturizing body wash strange, but sapping all moisture from the skin with soap is not good, if you don't moisturize afterwards all that water is escaping and creating wrinkles and discomfort. My boyfriend really liked this, he never uses any lotions but sometimes the skin on his upper back hurts as he says and I have to massage it with thick creams because it's in distress, but after using this for a while he doesn't need the cream as much, which I don't mind putting on but I'm happy that his skin isn't bothering him anymore.

This smells nice and works great, leaving the skin soft and smooth at the same time, who says men can't take care of their skin...I think it's hardly vanity and more of a necessity to take care of one self.",1239840000,0,0,0,0,1

After using the razor for three weeks to get used to it, it is still a bit of a let down.  It does very well cutting the hair along the cheeks but doesn't to very well along the chin and neck and found myself going over these areas over and over again to get the desired shave even breaking out my conventional razor occationaly to get a few pesky hairs that just wouldn't cut.

There are plenty of pros about this razor.  The trimmer does a decent job evening out the sideburns.  The razor tells you how much time the battery has left so you should never run out of juice in the middle of shave and it is easy to charge either on the stand or in the carring case the razor comes with.  The razor is really easy to clean.  And there is little to no irritation after the shave aside from a couple minutes of numbness right after the shave, but it's nothing a splash of water won't cure.

But if you want a close shave, a conventional razor is better but when I don't have time to break out the shaving cream, this razor will definately be suffciant.",1197590400,0,0,1,0,0

I think that if you apply the strip, close your mouth and don't talk, eat, or keep touching  the strip with your tongue, you will have a better chance of it staying put. You are supposed to leave them in place for 10 minutes and you cant eat for 30 minutes. I have had a problem with sensitivity to cold as I have gotten older.

From disinfectant spray, to wasp spray, and bedroom spray-I like natural and fresh scents. After browsing this page, the glass bottles looked similar to other glass bottles I've purchased. Normally I base my purchases off reviews however, few reviews were posted at the time (some for the product and some against it). Taking a chance, I ordered the set and they arrived quickly. The package contained two Cobalt Blue Glass bottles with plastic spray triggers. The issue I have is with the spray nozzles. If your using 100% Pure Essential Oils in your mixtures after a few sprays, the nozzles will clog or eventually quit working. To avoid this problem most sellers will include a cap (for free). By including a cap you are able to shake and combine your oils, witch hazel, vodka, etc. When you shake up your bottles using the plastic sprayers the oils will slowly eat away at the inner rim. I contacted the seller and they kindly explained no one has brought this problem to their attention, the company- will look into it. I uploaded some pictures, in one of the pictures I show the difference between a powerful spray nozzle versus the flimsy nozzle. Also included is a picture of how I bottle and label my mixtures. I appreciate you for taking time out to read my review. I hope it was informative.

It is much brighter and this product has restored the moisture back to my skin. It hasn't done much for the scars but that's expected.

It leaves your skin feeling moist and clean, with a subtle but fresh scent. Usually my body feels very taut and dry after using bar-soaps, but not with this product.

The texture of the soap is best compared to the few ""organic"" soaps I've tried, which I love. The ""micro-grains"" are a nice added touch. They probably don't do anything--in theory they 'exfoliate' and 'remove dead skin cells'--but most importantly I like the way it feels. The soap lasts a long time too and doesn't shrink the second it gets wet (like most mainstream bars).

OVERALL: I would not recommend this for your face (even if you don't have normally sensitive skin) because I think it would be too harsh, but for the rest of your body - prepare to be amazed! This is a gentle bar soap that won't leave your skin feeling dry, smells great, and will keep you clean. I've tried bar soaps off and on, mostly off because I've been so disappointed by them, but this actually made me want to start using them again. Very impressed, Dove!

Update October 11, 2016- I started the Atkins diet. For anyone who has been on Atkins, you know this means bad breath and foul body odor as the body excretes ketones. Ick. Double ick. I have job interviews to attend and I can't show up smelling like a cesspit. These are helping keep my body odor free. My only negative thought about them is the coating flakes off if they are stored long term or banged around in a purse. It doesn't lessen their effect, but it does make them a bit messy.

These work on me by removing the smell of onions or alcohol seeping out my pores and my breath. I take a dose before stinky food or drink and then again around two hours later. I generally take three doses the first day then another dose the next morning.

There are some meals that are full of onions and garlic. I don't want to smell like sour onions or garlic for three days. These help resolve the issue. Most of the time these pills can at least lessen the smell exuding from my pores and stop the bad breath. For me, and for the few people I have had try them, they work.

They saved at least one relationship I had where the man had a major problem with eating onions or garlic. He could come home after eating those for lunch and I would smell it on his skin. Not on his breath, literally on his skin. The Mint Asure helped keep that from happening and within around an hour of taking the pills, the smell exuding from him would lessen.  I have been a fan of these since they were called ""Breath Assure"".

The new mint coating does make them harder to take without water, but taking them with water seems to help get them into the system faster so I don't mind it. I don't find that the mint coating does much to freshen breath on it's own.

Don't know why they work, but I am glad they do!

The sticky stuff added to the capsules is a bonus, suck it off then swallow. I can dry swallow many pills but these need liquid to swallow. They work fast, within an hour on me.",1431734400,0,0,0,0,1

The two cons are simple:

Price- $34 for a 4.5oz bottle is extremely pricey! I'm not sure I can afford to keep buying this product.

Time- The length of time recommended to scrub your face, and leave it on your face is a total of five minutes. There's not much else you can do while washing your face, so this either extends your shower time, or getting-ready time in the morning.

Swelling is a bad sign: bacterial infection causing inflammation. Untreated gum inflammation can loosen your teeth, cause bone loss and loss of the tooth. Inflammation also affects your entire bodily system including your heart. Do NOT ignore gum problems.

The $40-some dollars for this machine was a no-brainer compared to dental and medical treatments. If it does nothing else, it keeps the mouth cleaner.

Just as the most highly rated reviewer said: 2 weeks of diligently cleaning the gum pocket with the Pik Pocket tool, the swelling went down. I still clean it at least twice a day with a mild solution of bicarbonate of soda (baking soda) and warm water. A dental hygienist told me that baking soda changes the pH of the water, making it less acidic, which helps to kill some germs. It's cheap, safe, tastes a little salty. The only part of that I don't like is it makes the water container and the tips cloudy. It washes out easily!

Fortunately she likes the flavor of this Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection toothpaste. Described as ""mild bubble fruit,"" she just calls it bubblegum. I tried some myself and it is indeed mild. It reminded me of the bubblegum-flavored paste I used as a kid, though I didn't get any fruit flavors. Regardless, it's mild enough that even my picky kid - who hates ""spicy"" paste - liked this.

This is intended for six year olds and up, as it has pretty much an adult amount of fluoride (0.24%). The pump says that kids ages two to six can use a pea-sized amount. Obviously the concern here is potential swallowing.

It's been years since I've used a pump, and I forgot how much I liked them. This is virtually mess free, with a red button easy enough for my daughter to use in her own. All in all, I was extremely impressed by this toothpaste and might even use it from time to time myself. Recommended.",1470614400,0,0,0,0,1

This product did make my eyelids itchy. No irritation in my eye though when I accidentally got some in it.  I also noticed a weird looking line above my lahses that is lighter than the rest of my skin.

I've used this as directed.  I did see improvement but I think there is a natural plateau to the lenght and amount of eyelashes that one's DNA will allow. I've hit mine.

If you've never tried it, you won't believe how great it makes your skin feel and look, and this brush is a wonderful tool to start with.
First of all there are slight curves on the handle. This means that whether you grip the brush at the top or closer to the bottom it will be comfortable and not slip around. The bristles look to be natural, and have just the right amount of stiffness for exfoliation. Simply rub on your skin gently so that all of the dead skin flakes off.
Next, I like to get in the shower and use the brush while it's wet to both cleanse and to use the bumpy side to massage my legs and rear.

7634,5,"05 15, 2013",A1QBOC76MIOJYP,B00DY59MB6,"This is probably the ""smoothest"" tasting mouthwash I have ever used. It is a subtle mint flavor, yet still leaves your mouth feeling fresh. ""Smooth"" fits the flavor/strength perfectly. It is not harsh at all, but still effective.

This mouthwash claims to help with inflammation and soreness of the gums. I'd say this claim is true. I wear braces and do get inflamed/sore gums from time to time. Crest Pro-Health For Life has helped with that. It actually soothes the gums. The inflammation goes away much quicker.

I used this in my WaterPik with great results as well. Normally, I fill it up half way with warm water and the rest of the way with Listerine. My orthodontist recommended this on account of the gaps I get from my braces, to clean good and disinfect the loose gum area and to help the irritation/inflammation. I feel like this Pro-Health does a better job in that area - it feels like it is soothing the sore spots and like I said, the inflammation, soreness and redness goes away much faster.

I did ask my orthodontist about using this mouthwash, if it would be beneficial to me in regards to the gum issues, since this product is meant for people over 50 years of age - I am only 36. He said it definitely could not hurt to try and would probably work well since it is made for gum issues. He told  me to let him know how it goes. When I told him I believed it worked better and helped more, he told me to continue to use it. When he looked in my mouth in order to determine the adjustments for my braces during that visit, he mentioned to me that 2 particular areas look better than usual. The gum line at two specific teeth was always more red than any other area, even though it was never actually painful or swollen. Since I started using the Pro-Health, that redness has gone away.

To me, this product is very beneficial, while being gentle. There is no harsh alchohol taste, no nasty after taste. It is just simply a smooth mint flavor, just like the bottle says, that makes your mouth taste and feel fresh. In my case, it definitely did help with gum problems and for that reason I will continue to use it regularly.",1368576000,0,0,0,0,1

The cream has a consistency that is hard to describe but is just right, foams easily, washes off easily, leaves the skin supple and soft and with a scent so delicious that I keep smelling myself for hours after the shower, it's just gorgeous beyond description. I also love the bamboo and rhubarb scents, respectively, they're just as good and some people might actually prefer one or the other to hibiscus, but for my taste hibiscus is sheer perfection when it comes to fragrance. By the way, I don't really know what hibiscus smells like, this definitely smells nothing like hibiscus tea, which was the only hibiscus scent I ever had a chance to try but it's a classy, elegant fragrance that just makes you appreciate life.

This one is ""textured"" which is not my favorite type as I am a former nail biter and the texture calls me to bite the nails, but I cover my wraps with clear polish and I just covered the wrap enough times where it is no longer raised. The pattern is cute.  I have had this set on for a week and it has not lifted at all.  When I apply, I put on a base coat of polish the same color as the base of the wrap; in this case a dark plum color. I do this because sometimes I use a wrap too small for my nail and I do not like seeing my nail edge.  By painting my nail, the nail blends in with the background color causing the edge of the sticker to blend in to the wrap.  After the coat of polish dries, I then apply the wrap, press it down very well with the tool provided, file off the excess, then cover the wrap with many coats of clear polish over then next few days.  On occasion my wraps will lift, so I just glue them back down with a brush on nail glue and apply another clear coat over the top.  These however have not lifted at all in over a week (8 days to be exact). The value of these warps, the beauty and quirkiness of the designs, and the ease of use, I highly recommend them.  You may want to use tweezers when applying your wrap.  It makes it a bit easier as they are a little thinner than Jamberry and if you are not careful and take your time they may roll on you a little. They unroll very easily though if you take your time. Hopefully you will like these wraps as much as I do.",1453420800,0,0,0,0,1

They are good because they are amber so it keeps the essential oils from degrading from UV light. Also, that it's a heavy duty atomizer spray so there is nice mist. They have a long tube attached to the prayer so you can use the spray until the bottom of the bottle.

I started using a couple bottles right away and made a car spray with Cinnamon, Wintergreen and Peppermint essential oils mixed with water.

It is TOTALLY AMAZING how well my gums are responding to this treatment. Here is a list below of the MANY PROS of this unit:

+ Effectiveness with my gums, teeth and mouth: After using this just a short time, my gums are getting more of that lighter pink and healthy look I need for my gum health. And they feel so clean after each use. In addition, my teeth even look cleaner! Love the fact that this has 10 different intensity levels. The one  five are very, very gentle on gums (great if you have tender or swollen gums or if you are new to Waterpik). However, I am up to power 8 on this and will be up to a 10 soon) and this intensity works wonderfully on my gums. They actually enjoy their beauty treatment so to speak.

+ Pause Button on the handle  This saves the day for me as when I want to pause, the button is at my fingertips and this helps me not to spray water all around my bathroom.

+ Ease of filling and cleaning - This unit is easy to fill, clean and empty and I like the fact that it is stationery in my bathroom and does not take much counter space.

+ Attachments and what is included  This comes with 6 attachments: Classic Jet Tip, Toothbrush Tip, Tongue Cleaner, Pik Pocket Tip (my favorite attachment as it is really helping my gums), Plaque Seeker Tip, and Orthodontic Tip.
In addition to the attachments, there is a Quick Start sheet to show you how to setup the Waterpik and also there is a small owners manual that has much information on how to use each attachment and how to overall use the Waterpik with pictures and step by steps.

The product is very good as it is easily untangles my hair and doesn't pull it.
I think they priced the product right as well.

UPDATE:  8/10/14
  I know this will sound crazy, but, I have a very finicky cat who doesn't like to be brushed.  Well, she has a very finicky owner who thinks she should be brushed everyday.  We were at a standoff.
When this pink brush arrived, she paid a lot of attention to it. One day while brushing my hair, she came up to be and made that cat sound that turns your head.  :-#
I didn't know what she wanted, but as a joke, I tried to brush her with my brush...this Alaska brush.  She loved it!  She let me brush her for half an hour...a true miracle.
Well, needles to say, this is now kitty's brush, and at least twice a day she comes up to it, and meows.  She actually wants to be brushed!  I tell you it's a miracle...no more cat hair anywhere!
I am sharing this story, because I am sure there are other animal people out there trying to find a great brush...look no further...and at such a low price.  Good luck!!

I started using their Volume shampoo a while back, and decided to give the conditioner a try - and I'm happy that I did.  My hair is thinning...okay, it was thinning ten years ago...now it's just thin.  Moving on - my hair is thin, and I keep it short, but I can still tell a difference in how soft it is after using this.  I don't use this every day, but almost.  It doesn't add too much time to a shower, and it doesn't cost all that much.  I think it's well worth it.

Other reviewers have remarked about not liking the smell.  Like any hair product, that's all personal preference, and you may or may not like it.  If you can, go to the local store and check out the smell for yourself.  It doesn't bother me one bit, but I also like the smell of the Volume shampoo.

So, for me, it's certainly five stars.  I've been buying it for years and will probably continue to do so because (a) I like it and (b) I'm nothing if not a creature of habit.  I certainly recommend it, but I do think it's good to try out locally first if you can.",1429315200,0,0,0,0,1

For the three ten-spots I paid, I'm satisfied.  It basically cost what replacement blades for my other shaver cost.  I will say that this shaver doesn't appear to have the same quality of build as my last Norelco.  It is lighter, doesn't feel as good in the hand, and has a cheap plastic feel.  The motor sounds like it's less powerful than my older model (which listed for a similar full retail price when new); even with a full charge it doesn't sound like the blades and spinning around very fast.  That being said, the thing isn't particularly quiet either.

Gives an adequate if mediocre shave.  Requires lots of passes over the same area of skin in order to get everything.  All in all not a terrible buy, but not a great find either.",1169424000,0,0,1,0,0

It offers a smooth, effortless shaving experience, and while the vibrating head may not make a quantifiable difference in the closeness of the shave, it certainly feels good and makes your daily routine a little more enjoyable.

The problem is, all this comes at a hefty premium. You may find refills on sale occasionally, but not at deep discounts. I've tried to lessen the cost by stretching blade life to one per month, but for my beard, I can start feeling more drag after about two weeks, and I've never been able to push it beyond three weeks.

Out with the Clinique, even out with the blue bottles, it must all go.  Now here is another product that is better than any of the Clinique products I depended on and at a fraction of the cost.

This is a retinol serum.  I use it on my clean skin before I put moisturizer on in the morning and at night.  .  I think that it multiplies the effect of a moisturizer by making it easier to absorb.  After six weeks of using this, my skin has a better texture and feels softer.  I don't see the finer lines on my skin.

I have always been careful to use quality products on my face for the past thirty years and this is one of the best lines of products.  These are products that are the same quality, but at a much lower price.  It's just amazing.

First of all - the speed of the jet is pretty fast - on a full speed, it can fly close to 8-10' - with that kind of speed - it can actually cause your gums to bleed (atleast mine did) and I had to reduce the speed where it comfortable for me (i keep the 4th/5th speed setting).

Of course, while fragrance is important, the soap is what's most important, and this is a high-quality, French-milled bar that lathers well, lasts a long time, and feels great on the skin.  The 250 g bar is substantial, feeling like luxury in my hand.  The bar is a muted yellow color with brown undertones.

If you haven't used French-milled soap before, you're in for a treat.  Triple- or quad-milled, the soaps have a uniform and hard quality that ensures that it doesn't ""melt"" in a soap dish and that gives it longevity that an ordinary bar doesn't have.  It may cost more, but you get more usage out of it.  The lather is rich and instant.

I'm in love with most Pr&eacute; de Provence products, including this soap.  I've already bought some of their products to give as gifts for the upcoming holiday season because they all go beyond ordinary.

110 was pale enough for my ghostly-pale self, luckily. I apply it with a damp sponge and set it with translucent powder, and this stuff stays on ALL day. I wore it on an 18 hour day and it was still on when I went to wash my face at night. It's medium coverage, I would say, but I think it could be built up to full if you needed to.

It doesn't really claim to be oil-fighting, but on my oily areas it seemed to still stay pretty well. (I only blotted once during the 18-hour day, and it was far later than I normally have to blot.) I've had issues with drugstore foundation transferring in the past, but I would put this stuff up to the white-turtleneck test if I had to. Once you set it, it stays ON. And for the price, it's lovely.

6762,5,"04 21, 2016",A3TWPW6C78JPGV,B01C29P4I4,"I've bought a few sets of similar brushes on Amazon, and they're all basically the same thing.  There must be a single manufacturer or wholesale supplier, and then each seller rebrands them and distributes them as their own.  With that understanding though, these are still excellent.  The synthetic bristles do NOT drink up your foundation, so you don't lose liquid on application.  It's expensive to keep wasting foundation that gets trapped in the brush and washed down the drain after every use.  Also, the bristles are cut evenly, so all the brush shapes look correct.  I've purchased at least one set where the bristles were cut so crookedly that it looked like someone assembled the brush while blindfolded.

Three things:

1.  I'm sure people are  going to complain about how the brush roll smells strongly synthetic when you open it up.  It does.  But it goes away almost immediately.  It's the same kind of smell that you find on a lot of new plastic items.  Remember the way it smells when you unpack a new TV or DVR?  It's like that.  After a few minutes, you wouldn't notice it unless you stuck your face in it.  After a few hours, it's essentially gone.

2.  There's no explanation as to what each brush is for.  That doesn't bother me a bit, since I can always find a good use for a clean brush.

3.  The great thing about this set is that they DO NOT have logos on the handles, as shown in the product images.  The set I received has matte black handles, with no writing at all---which just how I prefer them to be.  Logos are distracting.

FYI, there's no storage space for any other makeup items.  I think it would have been clever to add a small zip pocket on the back of the brush roll, but I know that would have been potentially bulky and inconvenient.

Bottom line:  this was a great purchase.  I'm happy with this set, and I actually prefer to use these over my far more expensive Sephora brushes.  If I had known about these brushes before paying so much money for the Sephora brand, I would have bought these first.  They're soft, dense, they dry quickly after washing, and the bristles don't suck up all your foundation.  That's as good as it gets.

The one I am currently comparing this Pro-Health For Life version to is the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Glide-Crest-Dental-Floss-43-7-yd-6-pack/dp/B003DXK6QY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Glide-Crest Dental Floss - 43.7 yd, 6 pack</a>.  The packaging is different, and the taste is different ... but those are all of the differences that I could discover between the two Glide products.  Sometimes a product ventures into a different market - in this case, the 50+ (I'm 47 and I thought I qualified for this sub-group).

I wanted to qualify a few things and speak to two different audiences here:

1) To the Glide Floss Newbie - Glide offers a wonderful, easy flossing experience especially for those of us who have teeth with very small space between them.  The Glide products will put your regular floss to shame ... I used the standard&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Johnson-Johnson-Reach-Mint-Waxed-Dental-Floss-55-yards-Pack-of-6/dp/B004XEDMAE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Johnson & Johnson Reach Mint Waxed Dental Floss 55 yards (Pack of 6)</a>&nbsp;in some form or another for most of my life ... until I discovered Glide.  Glide is like a ribbon, not s string, and does a nice job.  In the past, it used to tout ""Teflon"" for creating a smooth experience between tight teeth.  I am unsure of this anymore as it isn't labeled as such as it was in the past.

2) To those who use Glide Already - there is no big difference besides a longer, stronger mint taste and a shorter amount of floss in the packaging.  (40 m vs 35 m in the new one).  Both products acted the same for me.  Same size, feel ... just a stronger, aftertaste with Pro-Health for Life version.

I don't see any comparative pricing listed ... but if I saw that the new stuff was priced significantly more expensive, I would knock my review down a star.  It really seems like the same stuff with a minor taste tweak and an entirely new target market.",1350172800,0,0,0,1,0

I am a big believer in freshening up my skin with peeling products, both of the physical and chemical variety.  Over the years I have tried many different types and they all contain some sort of rough, gritty substance to mechanically rub off the top layer of the skin.  One of my peeling products has sharp fragments of pulverized apricot shells, another crushed salt, and my latest relies on sugar particles.

I have never seen anything like this gel.  It is completely smooth and yet, after a few minutes of massage, chunks of dead skin ball up and come away. I find that rinsing with water is not enough to remove all the residual cell debris, so I use a facecloth or a sponge.  My face emerges refreshed and smoother than I thought possible with pores visibly tightened.  My sensitive skin loves this product and I have never had any undesirable side effects.  It's the sort of thing I can use before a night out, followed by makeup, or simply to prepare my skin for serum and moisturizer at night.

The modern, sleek container is really high-end and beautiful to have sitting on my bathroom shelf and, at the rate it's going, the 50 ml (1.69 oz) contents should last at least a month with regular twice-weekly use.

I always look at the ingredients before putting anything on my skin, and the list here is full of most reassuringly natural extracts:  camellia leaves, sea salt, aloe vera, argan oil, orange peel, papaya, pomegranate, cucumber and Dunaliella (a micro-algae found in sea fields).  As with other Simon & Tom formulations, there is an equally long list of artificial and toxic ingredients that are NOT included.  It only took me a couple of uses to recognize this gel as the best peeling product I have used to date.  The fresh aroma and smooth texture make this a joy to use and, after rinsing, I don't feel as though I have rubbed away my fingerprints.",1437696000,0,0,0,0,1

The shaving peformance is fine for me -- not as close as a wet shave but that's a good thing for me personally because the closeness of wet shaves makes my face break out.  Every 3-7 years I buy a new Norelco and they get incrementally better each time.

I'm writing to warn about one feature.  Every shaver I'd had up to this one had a physical slider switch to turn it on and off.  This models has a push button.  This means you can't tell BY TOUCH whether it's on or off.  This is critical for me because I usually shave in the car (sitting in traffic) with the stereo blaring and I can't hear the shaver (especially since the newer models are pretty quiet).  I turn it on and off a lot as traffic conditions change.

Further, when the battery is low, my previous shavers would just run slower and slower until they came to a gradual stop.  This one slows slightly (imperceptably to me, really) and then just ""falls off the cliff"" and stops cold.  So you don't get any warning really that it's about to run out -- if I knew it was running down, then I'd shave a lot faster!

And this is where the tactile power switch feedback is important:  if the battery's totally drained, but I'm not done yet, I'll leave it off for a minute and then turn it on for 5-10 seconds of shaving before it dies again.  With the push-button power control this is really confusing because you're never really sure what's on and off.  It turns out the the power button is like a pulse that gets sent to an internal microcontroller (I'm guessing), so after it's been off for a while the power ""position"" doesn't matter, it's really off.  You just push to reboot the thing.

So, my 7825XL was robbed out of my car last night and I'm buying another one of these, so I guess that's an endorsement.  But I'm bumping up to the next higher model with better battery status indication ...",1108339200,0,0,0,1,0

The hand held WP-450 model has a 2-year warranty, but I've never had the batteries last for two years. Some don't make it to 18 months. The one I bought a year ago now only lasts for about 4 or 5 sessions before the charge dies. I recharge them for over 24 yours when they get week, which is what Waterpik recommends. So I have two so I can use one while the other one charges. Got tired of all this and got this plug in model and I wish I had done this several years ago. Being tethered to the hose is not a problem at all, the hand unit is much lighter and more maneuverable than the battery model, lighter too. I use this on #7 setting on the dial and it is just about the same as my old 450 units with a fresh charge. The highest setting is really powerful! Control easy to use, uses the same tips as my old units. I floss first, lightly brush with a tooth brush, then use a Sonicare. After this routing my hygienist still found food under my gums during a routing cleaning! That is when I added the Waterpik to my routine and they never found food after that again. Amazing to see what flossing and brushing with a Sonicare leaves behind. I am 67 and my gums have receded, so I need the extra flushing power of a water flosser. Dental floss does not get down between the gum and base of the tooth. I recommend this for anyone who is either starting out with your first water flosser or using a rechargable unit that you don't want to replace every 18 months because the battery is failing. Extra tips store in the lid to the tank. Tank easy to remove for cleaning. Can even be washed in the dishwasher if you remove the rubber valve/plug unit. I love the design, tube coils up and stores in the side of the unit with the handle slipping in a holder, all tucked out of the way.

If you have dry, brittle or peeling nails, the moisture will help to condition them. These gloves ensure that the hand or nail products stay on your hands or nails.

Before I started using it, I'd been using an eye cream I liked very much but it's light cream and I felt I need a ""heavier"" cream during the cold months. This one is exactly what I wanted - it smooths the fine lines around my eyes better than any other cream I've tried (I've tried Clinique and Elizabeth Arden, as well as the less expensive brand like Neutrogena, Garnier, Nivea and Olay). The other great thing is it eliminates the eye puffiness so well that I stopped using my gel eye patches (which I used to apply several times a week as my eyes did look puffy).
The one things I am not happy about the cream: it is grossly overpriced - the price in Bulgaria is about $5 (I'm Bulgarian).
BTW, my opinion is not biased based on the fact I'm Bulgarian - I bought the cleansing gel and the serum from the same series and they cause my skin to break out, which is why I do not recommend them to people with sensitive oily / combination skin (such as mine).

I am a big believer in essential oils for mood and health and have a number of essential oil necklaces and bracelets but I liked this one so much because it has a hummingbird on it. I absolutely adore hummingbirds. I also liked that it was chunky and looked well made.

It definitely IS well made. The chain is sturdy and the one inch circular pendant is very detailed. You can see every detail of the hummingbird and flowers. It opens so you can out a can put a cotton ball or cotton round inside with essential oils on it. The openwork of the pendant allows the aroma to waft out but I doubt anyone would know it is an essential oil necklace because it is so pretty on its own. It's a bit of a Southwestern piece with a dangling drop at the end. I love it. It gets a lot of compliments and even more when I show people that the pendant opens to use an an essential oil holder. I suppose you could also put a photo or something similar inside as well.

In all, a very well made necklace/pendant by Nature's Alchemy. I attached some photos but these days they often don't show up so I can only hope.

My son has a medical device (dex cgm) that includes a sensor attached to his body that is a little bigger than the larger nail wraps. It gets boring and it's nice to change up how it looks a bit. The larger nail wraps do a great job of changing it up and adding a little fun at times to the dull medical device.

These nail wraps are a little smaller then others we've had so they don't cover the entire sensor quite as thoroughly as others we've used, but it's decent.

Nail wraps work much better than stickers or things like that. Nail wraps look more like they are painted on, like they belong there vs stickers. Plus this devices gets a lot of wear and sticks don't last and look awful quickly. We also typically cover the sensor with a clear tape and it sticks to stickers and so even covered they come off as soon as the tape is removed. Nail wraps, are more oa nail polish and last a long time - they can last a few months if you don't decided the change it sooner.

While the Tattify wraps are a little small, I LOVE that they offer a lot of boy and many teen appropriate designs. The hard part of changing the look of medical devices has always been finding designs that a boy and especially a male teen likes.

The second use - we have a teen daughter. Our son gets the bigger ones for his sensor, our daughter gets the small ones for her nails. It's a great double use and win win all around.

This 'Tribal' design is cute.  My son likes it, and my daughter is biting at the bit to get ot use them on her nails.

More importantly, it made shaving around a beard too much of a ""guessing game.""  Especially if you try to maintain a consistent, even line between beard and skin at the neck, the Norelco leads to frustration--the line is constantly moving lower while becoming increasingly irregular.

Put simply, this Remington is the one to get if your face is of a hirsute nature. (Braun once won my allegiance--until I added up the cost of continually replacing those delicate, ripped foils).  The Remington MS2-390 is not only quite rugged but ergonomic, inexpensive, and darned effective.  As for the ""noise"" that many complain about, I've come to regard it as an all-business wake-up call, a high-pitched buzz of excitement confirming that the day's first task is under way--not to mention well in hand.

To extend the metaphor, the Norelco is a cumbersome, bloated bomber from the German Luftewaffe whereas the Remington is a British RAF Spitfire which, in the hands of a skilled pilot, can fly circles around any of the balky Teutonic Titans.

Today's razors are so much better than years ago.

Even though this is a wet or dry shave razor it seemed to drag a bit when dry shaving. Maybe because of some slight perspiration I don't know, but it did not move smoothly over my skin. Than I thought of Williams Lectric Shave, something I have heard of for years but never tried.

The first thing I did when I got it home was smell it and was not impressed with the odor, in fact I thought it was extremely unpleasent. I figured I'll use it to shave, than wash it off and that will be the end of it. But NOooo I shaved than washed it off 1 time, 2 times than a third time and the smell did not disappear from my face or hands. Plus the odor lingered for hours. I don't know if it is just me but I think the smell is just awful And I would not buy it again just for that reason. I would check out the other brands on the market.

As for the actual purpose of this lotion, I was impressed it worked exceptionally well. The razor glided over my face without any kind of drag and evidently did what it was supposed to since I got an exceptionally close comfortable shave.

So 5 stars for the shave and 1 star for the Odor. I have plenty of after shave lotions that I really like and resent the fact that I am forced to use there odor if I want a good shave. Odorless for this product would be a definite plus. My 2 cats won't eat any treats I give them if I have this odor on my hands, at least I have 2 paw's up on my assessment of the odor.

The brush was still going strong so I opted to keep the old unit and just buy the flosser.  Turned out to be a great decision.  The Waterpik unit is small and doesn't take up much room next to the combo unit.  It is considerably cheaper to buy the units separately so when the brush dies I'll simply purchase the brush independently.  A plus is that I find the Waterpik far superior to the Braun for cleaning.,1393718400,0,0,0,0,1

I've used Exfolikate for several years, and it *does* live up to the hype and cult-following; you get results after even a single use.

Some people don't like Exfolikate because they think it's too aggressive;  I once heard someone say it should be used for scrubbing bathrooms!!  I think it really depends on how your skin is....and only you know that best.  For me, it works very well--my oily skin doesn't slough off easily, causing skin particles, oil, and hard water in San Francisco to combine into invisible pore-clogging scum.  Exfolikate helps---it removes dead skin to smooth my face and de-gunks my pores so they're (temporarily) less noticeable.  I use it 1-2 times per week, and leave it on for about 3-4 minutes prior to showering.  From personal experience, let me warn you: DO NOT try leaving it on longer because you think you'll get even better results.  I once left it on for 25 minutes, and really regretted it;  it took off too much surface, leaving me with raw skin which kind of dried out/peeled off after a couple of days.  Lesson learned the hard way.

If you use it right, starting conservatively until you know how your skin can handle things, it's a great option.

So I ever so slightly lifted the corner the pump hole is on the water canister facing the pik it's on your left side towards the front corner...anyway I lifted it just a real tiny amount like maybe less than 1/4 inch or even no more than an 1/8 even. And a couple bubbles came up and I set it back down seating it again and the water came through right after that. So it was an air lock. That simple and that simple a fix but sometimes an airlock might be larger than the few small bubbles I had emerge. So you might have to work it a bit  maybe even shake it back and forth gentle of course. This kind of information might be helpful and prevent returns in the future. But the sellers need to realize this and tell you or warn you in the descriptions. Also Really WATERPIK should have this in it's brochure or manual as it is and tell you right off that it can occur. Been no problem since by the way.,1356220800,0,0,0,1,0

This nail care system comes with a file(blue), buffer(green), and shine(white) attachments that easily fit onto the device. This nail care system does run off of one AA battery which is not included and the battery compartment is at the very bottom of the device. This system does have some sound to it but it's not overly loud or annoying. The file works really well and for me personally does a better job than when I use emery boards. The buffer doesn't show too much of a difference but it does better than others that I've used previously. The shine does give my nails some shine; it's not drastic but my nails are more shinier than they were before. Overall I really like this system as it does make some difference to my nails and I'm not expert in healthy nails! I would recommend this Electronic Nail Care System!

The cream has a consistency that is hard to describe but is just right, foams easily, washes off easily, leaves the skin supple and soft and with a scent so delicious that I keep smelling myself for hours after the shower, it's just gorgeous beyond description. I also love the bamboo and rhubarb scents, respectively, they're just as good and some people might actually prefer one or the other to hibiscus, but for my taste hibiscus is sheer perfection when it comes to fragrance. By the way, I don't really know what hibiscus smells like, this definitely smells nothing like hibiscus tea, which was the only hibiscus scent I ever had a chance to try but it's a classy, elegant fragrance that just makes you appreciate life.

I added this to my garment steamer as well as my steam iron and both impart a lively French Lavender scent that remains long enough to get noticed.  My bottle did not come with a sprayer but I guess this would be another way to use the product:  spritz over fabrics like couches, beds linens.

One thing that was odd about this is the lid was on rather loosely with no safety seal.  Some of the product had leaked into its inner shipping poly bag.  Perhaps a safety seal would eliminate this from happening as well as add a modicum of safety.

In terms of potency, the product I received for this review has a very noticeable lavender scent.  It does not appear weak or understated at all.  Since others have had this concern, it does make me wonder about the company's QC.

So, I waited for my favorite tv show to come on (so I wouldn't be tempted to walk around while waiting for my toes to dry) and began. In total, this is a three step process: apply a coat of color and wait, apply a second coat of color and wait, and finally apply the gel coat and wait. If you take your time, the end product is lovely! Nice color and super shiny!

Now, I know you might be tempted to use a heavier layer of color and then a heavier layer of color for a super rich look. Avoid this. By following the directions and using two regular coats, you are going to get a less streaky and more uniform color. Trust me, if you go a little heavy, it's going to take longer to dry and look clumpy. So, by going the easy route, the product is going to look its best. So, win-win!

This is a hearty polish! It does not chip easily and lasts over one week on fingernails and at least two on toenails! So, this is worth the price.

Like I would imagine many to initially be, I was slightly skeptical, But as long as one frequently washes out the accumulated hair and debris from shaving the face, this razor will do the job that it is designed to do--the razor is absolutely worth the price. The rotating cutters are sharp and they deliver a smooth shave. I use ""Williams Lectric Shave"" as the pre-shave lotion. The razor can be used while wet, it is easy to clean, and the screen shows how many minutes you used up during that particular shaving (hahaha) and how many minutes there are left before the need for recharging. Some of the information that appears on the screen can look frivolus, such as icons to show that the razor requires cleaning or that the heads require replacing. But the heads function efficiently for a very long time before you feel that they should be replaced---maybe the replacement icon is a bit of a marketing ploy--the set of replacement heads costs about $30. Like many Norelcos of that kind, this one has a trimmer in the back--good for trimming the mustache and edge hairs. All in all this is a fun and efficient electric razor that is the best that I have ever had. The only notable wear and tear on mine is the rubber wearing and tearing off in the area of the swith--but is normal depreciation from long-term use.",1279843200,0,0,0,0,1

I have it in Viva and although it isn't a color I would have normally picked out on my own (it's a rich rose vs. the more neutral mauves I tend to favor) I really, really like it.  It seems more grown up than other shades of pink and I've found it suits my coloring perfectly.  (I have fair skin with a very slight yellow undertone (My pantone color is 1Y05), blonde hair and gray/green eyes and I thought this looked fantastic.)  I especially like wearing it with a smokey eye since it is a little less dramatic and offsets such a bold eye well.

In addition to looking great on, I also enjoy the feel and staying power of this gloss.  It definitely doesn't feel as slippery as other glosses, but is far from sticky.  If I had to describe it's texture I would probably say it's on the thick side and a little tacky.  This works to its advantage because it has good staying power, making it perfect for special events.  It also seems to be somewhat moisturizing, though I would never skip my chapstick and lip primers as I have very, very dry and flaky lips.

Overall I think this is a really lovely gloss and one of my favorites.",1392768000,0,0,0,1,0

This naturally occurring nutrient is found in every living cell of your body, and provides the source of all cellular energy for building new cells and tissue for smooth, firm skin. As a powerful antioxidant, CoQ10 neutralizes free-radicals caused by sun and environmental exposure defending your skin against further damage.

This is the most delicious cleansing crme. Not only does it smell like a field of flowers, it is 84% organic. This soap-free formula is blended with CoQ10, lavender floral water, Aloe Vera and green tea to help prevent wrinkles and give you a wonderful cleansing experience. It is 100% Vegetarian and there is no animal testing.

They say to dampen your skin with warm water first, but I just put this straight onto my face before getting into the shower. It is soap-free so it won't dry out your skin. I've also used it as a moisturizing mask.

For a quick face cleanse try smoothing this luscious yet lightweight cream all over your face, just take a warm washcloth and wipe it all off. For a beneficial moisturizer, look up Avalon Active Organics Vitamin C Moisture Plus Lotion with SPF 15. It smells like freshly squeezed orange juice. In fact, the cream is very healing and you can use it anywhere on your body where you need healing.

Which is when you need this product the most, during summer days running around barefooted.  You develop quite the thick-soled hooves!  I was able to do the perfect test as one of these socks slipped off during the night, so I had perfect data.

The foot that kept the sock on WAS smoother, moisturized, and softer.  No two ways about it.

The booties are really just all natural unbleached cotton no-show socks, thin material probably fits all sizes up to a 10.5, Womens.

I used some lovely Judith Krantz moisturizer and slipped on the socks.  A couple of hours later, one was off, I kept it off to see the difference.  And there is a difference.

I absolutely think this will be an enormous help if you have dry, cracked, and/or calloused feet.

What I like:
Before use, the scent does have that iconic lavender scent that I found rather nice. It creates a good bit of lather. Leaves my skin feeling soft.

What I don't like as much:
Its pretty big, which isn't a terribly bad thing other than its just big, and when I dropped it on my foot in the shower: ow! Hefty soap!
As well, when Im using it in the shower, I cant smell that lavender scentit doesnt come through for some reason. Its rather pricey for soap, though I suppose its size is the reason and maybe the ingredients, but since I tend to use body washes and wanted to use this soap as a display soap in the guest bath, it being damaged nipped that.

4548,4,"12 23, 2012",A19MMYMZO363KM,B004M0FW8Y,I've got at least 14 year old case of 150 piks that are very close to these Doctors brand I actually like much better. They are similar in size and do the same thing thin on one side and with a bit of brush to the other end. Orthodontist gave me a few of these but I like my old package better...don't know if they are still made or perhaps got sold to this maker. Anyway still they are good just not thin enough to work between my tight teeth during brace work. An older brace patient and this is scary about keeping teeth and gums healthy during the process. So these do help and for me work better than wood picks but not as well as some of the others out there. I also love the batter powered Power Flosser it's called I think. It's not a water pik but it's a little battery powered pick that fits between your teeth along the gum line...they however do not do much for the upper teeth areas which floss does better if you can figure out how to pull it off. I've got rins on back teeth molars and that prevents any flossing there so these help reach areas in the back of teeth that even the water pik does not work well and the battery flosser can't quite reach well either with the braces in my teeth. I bought these knowing in advance what they were and that they weren't quite as nice as my orginal ones but wanted the cases. I bought 6 cases for what 2 individual ones were selling for a that time on Amazon...so no choice of colors but fine. I also note if you refill from bottom hole instead of pulling off the top they last longer and less chance of breaking them too. So that's what I do. Also I could get about 4-5 more piks into the cases without having them stop up because there was too many also. I do like it when there is a case to carry these kinds of things about. So like the case and wish the picks themselves were a lot thinner on the thin end. I have very tight teeth. Also lose the teeth on the other end because all they do is grab my braces when I try to use them. Total waste of time and energy and spoil the mission or purpose of use.,1356220800,0,0,0,1,0

While I am a HUGE fan of Colgate Optic White toothpaste (by far my favorite), I was sorely disappointed when Colgate came out with this.  I have been using Crest 3D White rinse as part of my regimen, and I had high hopes for this based on the toothpaste.

I can say that it is effective, possibly on the order of or even a hair better than the Crest 3D White in terms of cleaning/whitening, but the offensive taste is just not worth it.  Also, I feel it is stronger and can lead to a burning sensation if I rinse too long.

In all, I will stick to Crest 3D White Glamorous White.

I suspect it would work well as a carrier for other essentials if desired, though I haven't tried that yet. I have very dry hands, and tested it there first, and felt it quickly absorb, my cuticles have felt better all afternoon!

After my bath this evening I used it as an after shower moisturiser, and feel so luxurious. It absorbs quickly into the skin, and doesnt feel greasy so much as it feels like a heavy lotion on the skin. I am excited to continue using this product, being a nerd I looked up some science, and learned that Avocado Oil is supposed to have something called sterolin in it, which I haven't heard of previously, but is helpful for spots and softening of the skin, I believe the softening part, and will be using it on my feet before bed tonight.

It has all kinds of different brushes for any need you have. This set will help you to get the look that want when applying your makeup. They all have long smooth handles and the brushes are very soft. I love the blush brush a lot and the angled eyeliner brush. It helps to blend in my eyeliner so it looks more natural. In addition to the makeup brushes, you also get the brush holder, which helps to keep all your brushes neat and organized all together. It also is easy to travel with because you just put one of the cylinder holders on top of the other with all your brushes inside and woolah. They can easily travel with you. Now you can always have all your makeup brushes together when you travel. This was a great idea and I love that. None of the brushes will ever be squished or lost in this cylinder case. The makeup brushes stay protected.

This also looks quite nice on your dresser or in your bathroom; wherever it is you apply your makeup. The leather pink cylinder cases are cute and attractive and hold all the brushes nicely. In addition, if you have to move your makeup brushes daily because you don't have enough room to keep them out when you do your makeup they are very easy to move around because of the nice leather cases this comes with. Just pop the lid of one case onto the other case and they are protected from dust and the little pink case looks like a decorative item.

I am in my mid forty and it seems everything is either dropping or falling out, and that includes my eyelashes. I hardly ever wear makeup anymore except for moisturizer on my face since I have permanent eyeliner tattooed on my eye lids. I just do no like that heavy caked on makeup look.

IM Natural Mamey Mascara goes on light and dries flake free. Makes my lashes look natural and not like thick black spider legs or like I am going out for the night. Best of all it washes of so easily. However, I do wish the brush was longer and not so short and fat.

In regards to Mamey Oil, it comes from the Mamey fruit that grows in Mexico, Central America, Caribbean and south Florida to name a few. It has an excellent source of vitamin C, and B6, as well as a good source of vitamin E, potassium and copper. Besides being different ways to consume it, it can be used for hair and scalp and now proven to help thicken, strengthen and help grow longer lashes. Perfect match for me and my falling eyelashes.

I have only been using this mascara for a short period of time and I quickly noticed less lashes on my bosom or in my eyeballs. So yes I am a believer that it does help strengthen eyelashes. In regards to helping grow longer, only time will tell. I can tell you that this mascara does not clump and goes on light and not heavy.

Incredibly it is an 8 pack box so it should last you a long time.

I'm not sure why I've gone out of my way to avoid this particular razor for the past 40 years--probably because of its dorky looks.  Face it, it's just not very ""masculine"" in its appearance--more ovarian than phallic, more like the grail than the lance.  But if you're willing to sacrifice form to function, this razor can't be beat.  It's the first one that caught every single hirsute strand on my neck in a single pass.

If you're beardless and unmustachioed, the Norelco is a bonafide no-brainer.  If you've got a number of hedges to trim around, the Norelco doesn't give you as clear a view or precise a cut as a more conventionally shaped Braun, Remington, or Panasonic.  On the other hand, the pop-out trimmer is the best I've ever seen, perfect for weeding out, pruning, shaping those less accessible areas.

As for spending fifteen to twenty bucks more for the next higher model (6843XL), the only difference I can see is color (blue instead of silver metallic) and a faster charging time (perhaps useful to those testosterone-rich individuals who require a shave every hour).",1145145600,0,0,0,0,1

I have love-hate relationships with anything hose relatedhoses either kink or nozzles don't thread well.

It took over 8 hours to fully charge it the first time, but once it is charged, you can leave it resting on the charger when you aren't using it.  I love the small brush attachment, because I have a small mouth, and the bigger attachments don't work as well for me.  I have used a Sonic Care in the past, and I didn't care for the size of the brush and the charger was really big.  The Sonic Care tickled my mouth and if I barely pulled it out of my mouth, toothpaste sprayed all over my mirror.  That doesn't happen with this one, because the brush is small and easier to maneuver.  The only thing I think it's missing is a toothbrush cover for the brush.

Every 30 seconds, it beeps so you can change locations.  I brush the top outside, when it beeps, I switch to the top inside, etc.  It turns off when it is finished.  I like how it stops if you are brushing too hard.  This is very helpful, as I tend to do that.  I just recently had gum graft surgery for recession, and I am now very aware of how hard I am brushing now, so that I don't destroy my gums again.

You can buy larger brush attachments for this, and it comes with one.  I haven't used that one, as I prefer the size of the smaller one.

The scent was just over-powering in the shower.

This bar though is mild in comparison and very pleasant.  About on par with the normal pink or green Dove bar soap that we sometimes purchase.  (I think the white has the least smell.  White Dove is our household standard.)

Second, I like how it didn't dry out my skin.  It's Winter and my skins a dry mess right now, but this bar doesn't appear to be making the situation worse.

But, I don't always have the time to sit down and spend hours creating unique and fantastic designs on my nails. Thankfully, I found these GORGEOUS gold stickers. They are the PERFECT addition to my nail art collection and make it easy to have stunning nails in a flash. I use them with UV gel polish (after your two coats of color and before the top clear coat), and they still look amazing 14 days later! When they first arrive, it might look like they are going to be difficult to apply. But, they are NOT!! Seriously - SO easy!

After you have your color on (you don't have to use gel like I do!), use tweezers to remove the sticker from the backing and apply it to your nail. Then, take your manicure scissors (you know, the ones with the teeny tiny tips), to gently and carefully trim around your nail and remove the part that isn't on your nail. After you're happy with how much has been trimmed away, use the beveled edge of an orange stick to make sure the sticker is fully adhered to your nail and then apply your top coat. It might look like a lot of steps, but I assure you it isn't. It is SO easy!!

Like many of you, I rely on the reviews I read here on Amazon before I buy anything.

Some, definitely NOT all, of the items I review are offered to me for a discount. My opinion and review is never persuaded by this fact. I do not only review items that are sent to me at a discount either, the majority of my reviews are on items that I paid full price for.

6849,5,"05 5, 2016",A134NIV2F2SIN9,B01DFHDMS6,"I received these self tanning mittens, and I like the application ones because they are soft and can help apply the tanner evenly. Great quality self tanning mitts. I was surprised by how plush they were. The large mitt is perfect for body application that will give you an even result without splotchy or dark patches. The facial mitt is large enough to insert a few fingers and it is sure not to irritate given how soft and fuzzy these mitts are.  Both the application mitts are of really good quality and feel like micro suede. But this is a set, and exfoliation is really important, and as mentioned by other reviewers, this exfoliating mitt (which is the dark colored one) is really thin fabric, and I'm not sure I would want to take this in the shower with me.

When I received these I was thrilled, they are sewn together very well and no foam to break down over time! These feel like thick velour mittens. My first thought was that they would suck a lot of product and it would be wasteful, which I didn't want because I just spent an arm and a leg on the tanning mousse, but I don't feel like it did. It was easy to maneuver around my body really quickly without the mitt sliding around on my hand. After exfoliating use these soft and silky suede like feeling gloves to apply your self tanner. With these gloves I have found that the application time is drastically cut down. The tanner goes on smoother and more uniform and you use less tanner which in the long run will make these gloves pay for themselves. I prefer a pouf for a more through exfoliation before applying tanning products, but I think the exfoliating mitt is a great option if you have more sensitive or reactive skin.",1462406400,0,0,0,0,1

It's important not to go too light because the blush WILL look chalky or there will be no color payoff. So far these colors have been most flattering
1. Mata hari
Matte mauve pink. Gorgeous for everyday adds a natural looking flush to the cheeks. It is lighter than MAC slave to love blush which was one of my old favorites before I tried NARS!
2. Taos
Described as a dusty rose, but has coral tones on my skin tone. Has some shimmer but not very noticeable once applied to the skin. This one is very long lasting. Nice for brightening up your day...and your complexion!
3. Taj mahal
Looks very gold in the pan but adds such a pretty warmth to the cheeks that's a little shimmery and lit from within. There are many ravs about this blush on beauty blogs and YouTube and its true!
4. Desire
A scary bright bright bright pink in the pan but also very good quality giving cheeks the natural flush you crave for everyday. I've also seen this one on deeper skin tones and it still looks natural and flattering
5. Love joy
I was wondering if this would show up or just look like shimmer on my skin. After application it was a brownish berry color with slight shimmer and the blush I choose when I'm doing a strong smoky or colorful eye look. Looks very natural on my skin tone. Can't really be used to contour because it has the berry tone. The nars site describes this of a bronzed rose but on skin tones similar to mine would be berry toned.
6. Exhibit A
I've seen this on light medium and deep skin tones and it is widely flattering! Turns more red than orange on my skin but can look more orange on you depending on your undertones. Every woman should have this one in their arsenal. Some people believe this gives the most natural looking flush of all. It also photographs really well and looks good on video! Lol :)

Start your collection with any one of these if you're skin tone is similar to mine. NARS blush is one of the best blush brands out there I encourage you to try at least one even thought they have a higher price point. They are very pigmented and last a long time too!

Edit
I have grown my collection!
Torrid : a peachy shimmer....you would not believe how beautiful this is on my cheek...that lit from within look!

Sin: glowy mauvy cheeks very beautiful. Also gorgeous on lighter skin tones to my own

Dolce vita: with a very light hand i can pull this one off. A little harder to blend than the others

Amour: my new go to everyday color. Very beautiful and natural on my complexion. Probably the orgasm or deep throat for deeper complexions. I'm a mac nc43 btw. My love affair with nars continues.....",1343952000,0,0,0,0,1

599,4,"07 21, 2007",ABLOQZIL42W7I,B0001WXTPA,"I am a dentist who recommends Crest-brand White Strips to my patients becasue they do work to whiten teeth. However, they have to be used correctly and I recommend that you follow the directions exactly as specified inside the box.

1. First brush your teeth with a wet toothbrush to remove the layer of plaque (toothpaste is unnecessary). Rinse your teeth well with water.  Tooth enamel has pores, and the pores need to be open for the chemical to penetrate.

2. Use the strips as directed on the box.  The instructions will tell you to bleach twice a day for 30-minutes a time.  The inner part of the strip has a chemical called hydrogen peroxide; (in-office, or dentist-assisted dental whitening uses a 15-35% version of the same chemical) that causes the stains inside your teeth to be oxidized and turn white. Applying the strips has a small learning curve as you will probably bend or fold a couple of them before you get the technique down.

2. Leave the strips on for the time recommended in the instructions and do not overbleach your teeth, as this leads to sensitivity.

Disadvantages

1. Hydrogen Peroxide can ""burn"" your gums. If you notice a burning sensation when you use the product, it is the chemical oxidizing (or burning) your gums (it will turn them white with a minor chemical burn). Depending on how severe the burning is, it may cause you to want to stop the treatment. It is OK to stop the treatment for a day or two to let the gums heal. Once they are healed, resume treatment with the White Strips. Try to not get the strip on your gums.

2. Your teeth may become senstiive during the week treatment time. Try to tolerate the sensitivity if it is mild, but if more severe, take a day or two off to let the teeth settle down and then pick up where you left off. You may notice much more sensitivity to cold water, ice cream, etc.  The peroxide causes an inflamation of the inner pulp, or nerve center of the tooth and makes the teeth very sensitive to biting or cold drinks or foods.  If your teeth become too sensitive, back off on the strips until the sensitivity is gone before resuming bleaching.

3. The strips only cover your front teeth, so only your front teeth will bleach. You may notice the distinct difference between the back (unbleached) teeth and the front (bleached) teeth. Since most people notice the front 6 teeth anyway, this is not a big deal. However, if you have a wide toothy smile, you may want to have a dentist make you a tray that will hold the chemical on the back teeth to whiten them too.

4. The bleaching effect works best on yellow stains. If your stains are due to tetracycline (brownish grey stains in a band on your teeth, your best bet is to have a dentist whiten your teeth as the dentist will use a tray to hold a more concentrated form of the chemical on your teeth for a longer period of time.

Now comes the confusing part: Crest White Strips come in 4 different packages, each a bit different than the others.  The main difference is in the strength of the hydrogen peroxide, and the price.  The higher the dose of hydrogen peroxide, the most costly the product package.  Here are the 4 packages:  1. Crest White Strips Classic (6% hydrogen peroxide, 14-day treatment).  2. Crest White Strips Premium (10% hydrogen peroxide, 7-day treatment).  3. Crest White Strips Premium Plus (10% hydrogen peroxide, and has 12 additional strips).  4. Crest White Strips Renewal (9.5% hydrogen peroxide).  The cheapest method (at around 25 dollars, is the Crest Classic Whitestrips, but it takes 2 weeks to complete the treatment).  Premium and Premium Pro are both 10% peroxide formulations, work in 7-10 days, and the ""Premuim-Plus"" gives you 12 additional strips.  I am not sure why Crest recently came out with ""Renewal"", as it is a 9.5% hydrogen peroxide formulation which is not significantly different from the 10% concentration. Leave it to the manufacturer to confuse the consumer!

Crest White Strips work for the vast majority of people. Younger people with yellow stains seem to respond better than older people or those with gray stains.  White Strips don't work as fast as a dentist-made custom tray bleaching, (or in-office bleaching) but over time, you will get a result that will be close to that of a dentist, and you will save money too.

I recommend starting with with either the Classic or the Premium-Pro. The Classic works in 2 weeks and is about $1.80 a day.  The Premium Pro works in 10 days and is about $2 dollars a day.  The Premium and Premium Pro are likely to give you more sensitivity than the Classic.

If you are not satisfied with the results and still want whiter teeth, you can then see your dentist for a more concentrated form of bleaching using a custom-tray system or in-office bleaching.  This is much more expensive, but the concentration of hydrogen peroxide is much higher and this tends to work better on stubbornly-stained teeth.

As far as results go your mileage will vary but I do have one tooth in particular with mild, persistent issues whenever it comes into contact with ice. The strip does tone done the sensation by approximately 50% in my estimation so not necessarily an insta-cure but good enough to be noticeable.

Couple of things to keep in mind - each strip is very small and will cover 1 or 2 teeth each. The strips also do not 'stick' very well to the tooth so you'll need to be patient during the 10 minutes of application and try not to talk or move your mouth around. Also, I really like the convenience of having each strip individually packed making it easy to keep one in your bag/wallet while you're out and about should you ever need one.",1412380800,0,0,0,1,0

What I've found is that lavender scents can be tricky. Some are intense and other times they can be rather weak or not even smell like lavender at all. The Pre De Provence Maison French Lavender Blossom Linen Water is one that sadly falls into the latter category. I sprayed it on decorative pillows and at first it smelled really good They got the scent correct. But when I picked up the pillow 15 minutes later, it was no longer detectable. I tried it again, this time sniffing it 5 minutes later. Sadly, only the faintest hint of lavender greeted my nostrils. I was disappointed as Im a fan of aromatherapy, but this product just does not pass the muster.

I poured some full strength into my diffuser and it did work then, but that means using a lot of the product. Id rather just add a few drops of essential oil to water. Additionally, Maison has some questionable preservatives (Methylisothiazolinone (MIT) and Methylchloroisothiazolinone (CMIT)) and FD&C Blue 1 and Red 33, rather than just pure scent. It does not come with a spray attachment.

But after two years of steady use, I figured I'd give one of their other foundations a try. So I picked the dry skin formula in the color ""Sand Beige"", because that's the color I was using in the Whipped foundation.

Well, they're entirely different shades despite having the same name. Both swatches displayed are from products sold and fulfilled by Amazon in the past few weeks so I don't think it's an issue with age or authenticity.

Decided I'd give it a shot anyway:
Thin, and easily blended with my real techniques sponge.
Definitely NOT drying. In one of the pictures it looks down right oily, but that might be because of the flash reflecting off the zinc or the fact that I had only just put it on.
Definitely NOT full coverage, or at least not as full coverage as the Whipped. More moderate coverage, but it was easy to build up coverage with an additional application.
The one I received was a pump bottle so it's a lot easier and more sanitary than the jar on the Whipped.
By the end of a work day where I sit mostly behind a desk, it had begun to wear off pretty significantly. The after photo is taken roughly 11 hours after application. ***It's fair to note though that I do touch my chin a lot so it's reasonable that it would wear off.
Also, it looks very obvious in the photo that the texture changed throughout the day. I didn't really notice this looking at it myself or even in a mirror. Could again be the flash, but there were no filters added to any of the photos.

All in all, I do like the way it looks for a least the first few hours and I'll continue to use the bottle when I feel like mixing things up. But I'm still sticking with the Whipped.",1489708800,0,0,0,1,0

Like a lot of others, I put this in my hair and left it, like one would do with a leave in product. And that was actually okay for my hair, since it's not that I have fine hair, but that I've cut it from being long and thick, to a shorter and thick hair style. A style that needs a lot of body and not be weighed down by heavy products, or else I don't get the desired effect.

But that's not how this product is designed to work. It's supposed to be washed out in the shower. This works very well for making hair soft but light and fluffy. And it really worked well for my teen daughter, who has very fine thin hair. Normally she can't use any conditioner in her hair. She's at an age where her hair is getting very oily every single day, and already having very fine thin hair, the two are a bad combination. So she has to use clarifying shampoo every day, and no conditioner, just to keep her hair nice.

This conditioner however is so light and washes away well in the shower, that she can use it to help soften her hair without completely weighing it down and adding to her oily hair issues. It also has a very nice citrus cent to it. This is so nice I may just keep buying this for her, as it's definitely made for her hair type more than my own.",1408233600,0,0,0,0,1

I love good face masks and buy singles all the time, hoping to one day find one that's perfect.  This one does deliver on it's promise to brighten my skin and tighten pores- I could tell a noticeable difference in my face when I took it off- my face seemed lighter in color, and brighter, and my pores were about as tight as they ever get.  I didn't really find that it reduced fine lines though - so far only the 'at home chemical peels' that I use really deliver strongly on that promise, though some various serums and creams do help.

It comes in a net, and it's loaded with a white cream.  The mask itself feels like alginate material, and has precut eyes, nose, and lips.  The nose was too long for me, so the upper lip portion just was all out of whack.  It took a while for me to adjust it so I could breath and so that I had adequate facial covering.  It's to be worn 30 minutes optimally.  It is very hydrating, and it rinses easily when time is up.

I do like it.  I would not pay $20 each for one, but my budget is tight; others might not take issue with that.",1439078400,0,0,0,1,0

I was drawn in by the sleek modern looks of this razor. I'm always used Philips Norelco rotaries in the past and have been very happy with them. My last razor was a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Philips-Norelco-SpeedXL/dp/B001AMRQ2W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Philips Norelco SpeedXL</a>&nbsp;and I'd still be using it today if I had not worn out 2 of the blades after 4 years of heavy use. In fact, I keep it around to help get the stray hairs the Arcitec misses.

If your stubble is medium to heavy thickness, then this razor will annoy the heck out of you. What used to take me about 2 minutes now takes more than 5. It just doesn't want to cut ...and if you have more than 2 days' growth, you are really in for a problem. It takes multiple passes with me stretching my skin to try to get the hairs up for this razor to get at them, and even then it misses some. It is less than 6 months old and it's as if the blades have gotten dull. But they don't pull at the hairs so that is not it. It took 2 years for my last razor's blades to dull. This one just refuses to cut well. I clean and charge it religiously, so that isn't the issue either. To top it off, the small extendable straight razor is all but useless because the main shaving head gets in the way.

This is a good looking razor that holds a charge for a long time, but that is where the pros end. I wish I could return it but I waited too long. I'll be going back to the bulkier (but quieter) XL style after this one, or maybe even convert to a Braun. You let me down with this product Philips.",1274313600,0,1,0,0,0
8875,5,"06 18, 2016",A28HBJOYP6BL62,B01CY5NC44,"I have myself for loving these products.

They are made with shark cartilage. Which is never humanely sourced. I bought them by accident, I didn't know until I bought it. I looked up the items online on a whim later, and found out what was inside.

omg though... it's sooooo amazing on my skin.

I hate myself for loving them haha. I think, I may have to break my vow and keep buying these products.  I mean... I buy everything else humanely sourced, so... it evens out, right? :x

It has AHA and BHA to gently exfoliate the face. It makes your skin SO soft and SO smooth. Use with the toner. Use the toner about 15-30 mins before this, to let it fully absorb, and then use the emulsion with your regular skin routine. These products are amazing, they are so wonderful, they smell like citrus, they have great absorption, they are fantastic. Seriously, fantastic. I use a LOT of Korean skin care products, and these two products, well, actually all the Mogong Dodook products, have been phenomenal on my skin and far out performed everything competing with them. I haven't found a better toner, emulsion, or day or night cream. They are all fantastic. I love them.

It's not humanely sourced. Be warned before you become hopelessly addicted like me. From what I can tell the day/night cream is humanely sourced, it's just the toner and emulsion that has the shark cartilage in it. That seems to be where they got the collagen from, from what I can tell (the site is in Korean)

Check it out for yourself. But this stuff is seriously amazing.

This is the best floss I have ever used. It is strong and smooth and truly glides between my very tightly packed teeth.

I told them this in the store, as if it did any good.  SO, for all you out here who love the vanilla scent, try this, also sold on Amazon:

Monoi Tiare Tahiti Coconut Oil Vanilla -- 4 fl oz
Sold by: Express Health
$11.26

It is made in Tahiti and has a real vanilla bean in the bottom of the bottle.  Because it has coconut oil in it, it solidifies at 68 degrees, but all you have to do is put it into your hand and it melts.  It smells SO GOOD!  It also has Tiare flower scent in it that the Bath & Body Works formula had as well as Vitamin E and actual vanilla bean fragrance from a real vanilla bean.  It is only 4 ounces, but a little goes a long way and is only $11.26.  This is a body lotion and it smells awesome and is the closest thing to the B&BW formula I could find with a reasonable price tag.

After attending a lecture and finding out all the harmful effects Mircobeads are having in our world today, I removed them from my beauty regimen. After getting rid of those products I started using my (clean) hands to wash my face. After a few weeks I experienced dark spots along my forehead area and my skin just did not feel healthy. I knew I needed to find a product the could help me exfoliate successfully. I was blessed to be able to purchase this product at a small discount. After spending time with this adjustable Silicone Electric Waterproof Massager I'm sold. I love how easily it fits in my palm and I do not lose my grip (even with it soaking wet). Furthermore, I only have to recharge this device every couple of days. My face is clearer and my T-Zone is less oily. I use this product in conjunction with my Black Soap and my skin has never looked better. What's even more appealing to me is the fact I can do a search for this same product and see some costing up to thirty dollars. I even came across one for over one hundred dollars yet, it looked exactly like the device I'm using. The design of this product makes even the hard to reach areas (around the corner of my nose) a breeze to clean. Overall, my foundation goes on smoother, I have less dark spots, and I stayed within my budget. I recommend this Facial Massager. I uploaded some basic pictures for your reference.

This one surprised me. It worked really well. First off, I expected it to be smaller than it is. The last one of the face cleaners I received from another company was half this size, and the advertised price was even more. So just opening the box I was thrilled to find it wasn't another mini version.

Packaged with this Fyola cleaner comes one brush already attached, with a cover on the brush to protect the bristles. Also included is a second brush head, with slightly firmer bristles, and also has a cover on it. There's also a charging cable and a charging stand.

I was pleasantly surprised to find it was a wireless charging device. You just set the Fyola in the stand and it starts charging. Note that it needs to be in the charging stand facing away from you, not towards you like you might expect. You'll know you have it in the right way because the face cleaner will beep at you and the lights for each of the various setting will light up showing it's charging.

When the battery runs low, the Fyola beeps at you to let you know it's needing recharged. There are 4 different cleaning settings, sensitive, pulse life massage, exfoliate and deep clean. And they aren't kidding when they call the 4th setting deep clean. It's a strong setting that works great for getting color-stay foundation makeup out of pours.

There is an included instruction manual but it's so easy to use you really don't need to reference it for much, other than maybe familiarizing yourself with which setting is which.  The Fyola works surprisingly well and is a great full sized face cleaner.

My son I can't quite get used to using the mouthwash, but my daughter does and I'm sure it's the non-alcoholic nature of the wash that makes it acceptable as it's not that sting-y.

SUMMARY
Since my young teenagers are using this mouthwash I wanted one without alcohol.  My daughter uses it on a regular basis and for about two years.  It's impossible to say whether the mouthwash has worked or if the kids are just flossing and brushing more effectively, but they have had fewer cavities and improved dental reports.",1443139200,0,0,0,1,0

You can reset it to 30 seconds if it is moving ahead too fast.

Mind you I have 3a to 1b type hair and its very thin.

So I used it and it work good but I can't say that I am going to leave my flat straightener because I can't. As I said it works good on my hair but I still need to pass the flat iron after wards depending how my hair wants to act that day.
My daughter has very thick 3a to 1b as well and it worked good on her hair.

It heats up very nicely, it comes in Celsius degrees only so this is by what the instructions says:
210-230 for fine hair,
210-190 for general hair,
170-190 for soft hair

I went from lowest to 220 to see how my hair would take it. So I suggest for you to play a little with the degrees to see which one suits you the best. It heats up evenly and the tips does not get hot which is nice.

I passed it through the same section about two times and when I finished I brushed the whole hair to even out my style and if my hair did not grasp all I passed my flat iron.

To turn on just press the on/off key and hold for 3 seconds and then do it again to turn off. It also has a heat up and a heat down key which you manage the heat that you want.
This is like a regular flat iron you use it on dry hair only. I also love that it brings a swivel cord and a regular plug because I seen some on you tube and they did not bring a regular plug.
Also it has a one hour auto off function just in case we forget to turn it off which sometimes happens, so I am really glad it has this feature.

Over all I am really liking this product and it is very handy as well very sturdy and can be used anywhere. The shell is made by high-temperature resistant engineering materials,it has anion moisturizing and hydrating care which brings a deep care for your hair and your hair does not smell burnt while using this product. I one big thing is that it cuts off minutes or hours of you straightening your hair so that is a plus.

The scent is quite strong and lasting and it is relatively affordable. The company behind it is based in France, where a large part of the worlds lavender is grown.

Lavender itself has a fascinating history. While we think of it as a dried flower to be used for potpourri and sachets, historically it has been used more as food item, being used in baked goods and desserts, pairing especially well with chocolate. Lavender is said to have a flavor resembling rosemary and is often used as a substitute.  It is generally considered safe although the U.S. health department has issued precautions for young boys concerning possible hormonal changes. On the other hand, according to the ASPCA lavender has been shown to be toxic to dogs, toxic to cats and toxic to horses.

A suggestion to the company would be to switch to a different bag other than cellophane, which tears easily. I had more dried leaves in the box than I did in what was left of the cellophane bag.  Im sure using more of an air-tight sealed bag would also ensure less loss of potency than cellophane.

Swelling is a bad sign: bacterial infection causing inflammation. Untreated gum inflammation can loosen your teeth, cause bone loss and loss of the tooth. Inflammation also affects your entire bodily system including your heart. Do NOT ignore gum problems.

The $40-some dollars for this machine was a no-brainer compared to dental and medical treatments. If it does nothing else, it keeps the mouth cleaner.

Just as the most highly rated reviewer said: 2 weeks of diligently cleaning the gum pocket with the Pik Pocket tool, the swelling went down. I still clean it at least twice a day with a mild solution of bicarbonate of soda (baking soda) and warm water. A dental hygienist told me that baking soda changes the pH of the water, making it less acidic, which helps to kill some germs. It's cheap, safe, tastes a little salty. The only part of that I don't like is it makes the water container and the tips cloudy. It washes out easily!

The packaging is generic and nothing special. It comes in a squeezable tube and it is esy to get the desired amount of product you will need. it keeps the product fresh and it is portable so you can take on the go.

The consistency is gel-like but as soon as you massage it onto the skin, it melts and becomes a light water cream but not runny. It is easy to apply and it dries fairly quickly. It goes on clear and it does not irritate the skin. It has a nice cooling effect. It leaves the skin very smooth and soft.
Likes:

  Natural  ingredients
  It contains Manuka honey. I am aware of the many benefits of it which is the main reason I got this toner. I have not seen long term or visible changes in my skin yet but I'll keep you updated.
  The cooling effect
  Anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties
  It is not greasy, oily or sticky. It does feel a bit tacky while it is drying but once it dries it is no longer tacky.
  Light texture
  A provides some hydration. It is not amazing but I am glad that it does not over dry my skin.
  It does not irritate my skin or cause redness
  It has cause me to break out
  It does not leave my skin looking extra oily
  Cruelty free
  Recycle packaging

Dislikes:

  It does not dry out my skin but there had been occasion when I feel that this toner makes my skin feel tight and not very supple.  I think that it is the tightening of the pores but when my skin is feeling dry. I rather use a more moisturizing toner.
  I read the ingredients lists and it lists ""Parfum (fragrance)*"" which is never good for me. I have had bad reactions to added fragrances in the past. This has not irritated my skin but I wish that they did not added it. The fragrance is from natural essential oils but I wish I knew which ones. I can never be extra careful.

Overall Assessment:

* Price Point: 4/5
* Quality/Durability: 5/5
* Need: 4/5
* Recommendation: 4/5
* Overall Assessment of Product: It has some great ingredients and the texture is unique. I love the refreshing and cooling effect and how it makes my skin feel smooth.  I only wish that it was little bit more hydrating. For now, I will continue to use it and I will update this review with new information. I am not in love with it yet so we'll see.
