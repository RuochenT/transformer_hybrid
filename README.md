# transformer_hybrid
This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of three Transformers (BERT, RoBERTa, XLNet) in handling data sparsity and cold start problems in the recommender system. We present a Transformer-based hybrid recommender system that predicts missing ratings and ex- tracts semantic embeddings from user reviews to mitigate the issues.
